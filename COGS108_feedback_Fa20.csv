I am enjoying the assignments a lot. I feel like it's where I am learning the most and being most creative (within boundaries) to solve the problems. There's also that immense euphoric feeling when your code works on the first try.,"This was the very first time I ever had to use github (not a Cogs major so definitely new to this) and I felt that there were very little guidance I was given to validate that component of the assignment (it wasn't a lot of work, but it was worth a lot and I had no way of knowing if I did it correctly). I lost a point for a silly reason - but I spent around 15-30 min on that portion as opposed to the 3 hours on the actual assignment of the material that was taught on class.

What I have enjoyed most about COGS 108 is how learning in this class is not impeded by natural instinct or talent in statistics or programming.

I did not want to just ask too many different people and just work with whoever responds 1st in 1st come 1st serve type of manner since I felt I'd be disrespectful to those I bothered to ask, so I waited patiently to get responses from people I heard from 1st.

It gets everyone in the class to watch the lecture videos. But I think the questions on there are way too niche. A lot of the questions don't focus on the general picture of the lectures or sometimes they ask ambiguous questions that may have multiple answers. For example, in one of our recent quizzes, we were asked two questions where we were given scenarios and had to pick the applicable confounding variable. Due to the fact that the question is more qualitative, it is bound to be ambiguous, but I'd be cool if it was a little more clear cut. But then again, it might just be me.
