"The pace and the breadth that we cover. I feel like the structure is really nice, and  we are able to learn much about data science. It was very nice to have something different every lecture, and for the information to build off of each other (for example, pandas is basically the core of data science and we build a lot off of that). The balance between conversations/discussions and you actually lecturing is very nice since I feel like it allows us to discuss our ideas very easily while still getting content. ","The EDA lectures. I like them, but I do not feel like we need to have two of them. I would have liked that time to go towards other topics of data science, or so that we can have topics like runtime or efficiency within data science, since I feel like that would be extremely helpful for our projects (especially if we were to deal with extremely large datasets). I would also have liked to possibly expanded more on missing data and how to deal with that. The third assignment deals with Beautiful Soup and web scraping a bit, but I feel like it wasn't covered as much as it should have. Overall, part of the compromise of teaching such a breadth of material limits the depth we go into, but I still feel like some areas should be covered more (pandas, numpy, efficency, etc.) ",about as difficult as my other courses,about the same amount of work as my other courses,I do not attend weekly sections,"Lecture, Assignments, Office Hours, Piazza"
