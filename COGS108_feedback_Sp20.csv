I really enjoy learning about all the different types of approach to answer questions about data ,"I am not a big fan of all the quizzes we have to do. We don’t have enough time for the quizzes and even if we do watch the lectures, I think the questions are still quite difficult.

Data Science,Lecture Quizzes; every other day completion with fairly high difficulty (time/single attempt),about as difficult,about the same,3,4
I've enjoyed the video lectures the most. I find them very informative and punctual at the same time.,I don't like the video quizzes. Some of the questions take me longer than others to answer but we only get one minute per question. I've also accidentally started quizzes a few times.,about as difficult,about the same,2,5
I really enjoy the topics we've learned and I like using Jupyter notebook because it's convenient being able to run code together with the notes. ,I hope we can use github a bit more before the final project because I feel very unprepared with how github works still... I'm afraid I might forget something important for the final if we don't practice using github more. ,somewhat more difficult,somewhat more,5,2
I’ve liked the homework assignments and how they build on what we learned from lectures. They’re also not too time consuming which is nice.,"I wish we could focus a bit more on coding plots and like different things we could do with that, maybe go into greater depth in that area",somewhat easier,about the same,1,2
"Honestly, it's the fact the there are no tests, the times between when assignments are due are nice and long, which cause no stress and we can do them at our leisure, making sure we really understand the concepts! ","The 30 minute long videos :( But this isn't really an issue, it's just me being a lazy boi ",about as difficult,about the same,4,3
I have enjoyed the format through which the lectures have been provided. The videos that we are responsible for watching are so well-made that I might have ended up watching them even if I was not taking COGS 108 currently.,"As with all of my other classes, remote learning is a challenge. As someone who gets stressed very easily, it is very difficult to avoid losing a few points on the lecture quizzes in situations when I am unable to recall the specifics of the lectures in the moment. And those losses have added up.",about as difficult,about the same,1,4
Working on Assignments ,Quiz. Too many quizzes to take.,about as difficult,about the same,1,5
I like the concept and the Notebook assignments because I have never used pandas before so it is good for me to practice,I don’t really enjoy the quizzes but it makes sense since it forces us to watch the lecture,somewhat easier,somewhat less,2,2
the assignments have been a great opportunity to get hands-on experience with data science,"I don't like the clarity of grading. I feel like the quizzes often have some questions that ask about something that's really nuanced & I understand that the questions can't all be easy, but I don't think those question topics get enough attention in the video to give us the opportunity to have deeper thought about them. I also wish there was a way to turn in the assignments and see the grade on them before they're due (without necessarily seeing the correct answer) so we can get a better idea of how they're going.",about as difficult,somewhat more,1.5,4
The assignments are very well-designed and fun to complete.,Some questions in the quizzes are pretty tricky even though I pay close attention in lec I may still not get it right.,somewhat easier,somewhat less,1,2
The valuable experience in a programming language that is leading in the field of data science. ,"I wish we could divide the course into two or three. Though it serves as a good stepping stone for learning data science, for many cogs students it’s where that course experience ends. To supplement this, I’ll be taking cogs 109 and 188 but those classes are taught in Matlab. It’d be nice to have a central theme to some of these courses as python is arguably the most popular language for data science right now. ",somewhat easier,somewhat less,2,3
"Surprisingly, I really like the quizzes because they make it easier for me to assess which concepts I understand and which ones I need to focus on more before the assignments. ","I think the hardest thing for me so far in this course has been learning how to use github, since it is a very different platform for me and I have never used anything like it before. ",somewhat more difficult,somewhat more,4,6
I have enjoyed the video lectures and sections the most. They have been helpful to me.,"I feel like I am confused about many aspects of the course, whereas many other students are so far advanced that everything is a breeze. I only took cogs 18, so I am only really familiar with Jupyter notebooks; Github is very confusing and I don't really know how to do code on my local computer outside of jupyter. Additionally, the final project made me really confused, and I think I wrote a terrible proposal because I missed some of the information on Piazza.",somewhat more difficult,about the same,2,4
"I've really enjoyed learning how to use datahub and work with jupyter notebooks. The material feels very relevant to real life, and is genuinely interesting. I also like how the videos are all broken up into segments instead of having one big fifty minute video, because this is way better for my attention span. ","Not much. I confess that having timed quizzes give me a probably unwarranted sense of anxiety, but that's it :)",somewhat easier,about the same,2,2

",about as difficult,about the same,10,7
"working with my group.  They are all my friends and I don't get to see them as often (obviously), so it's fun to see and work with them in the group zoom meetings.","that unit tests are grouped in their grading. i.e. if a function is required to work and pass unit tests a, b, and c, we lose all potential points if it fails just one of them.  I understand why however, I just think it may be beneficial to us all to find these potential bugs beforehand.",about as difficult,about the same,2,3.5
I've enjoyed the collaborative work around the final project. ,"I think the pre-recorded lecture isn't conducive to me getting the most out of the course. I enjoy engaging with the material and my peers, and asking questions in real-time. I understand the need for asynchronous learning, but it'd be great if we could still meet up during lecture times to go over the material in real-time, if possible.",about as difficult,somewhat more,4,10

I really enjoy the assignments and what we have learned in the class.,Honestly the quizzes feels a little bit overwhelming. Sometimes when there are 3 quizzes in a day I get caught up with work and have forgotten to finish the 3rd quiz on two separate occasions. I get that you want to check our understanding but sometimes it is hard to keep up with the quizzes,about as difficult,somewhat more,4,4

The project proposal was really interesting to write. We spent a lot of time thinking of what we wanted to do and gathering data and prior works was really fun.,"The quizzes really stress me out. It feels like they're such an important part of the grade (20%!) and sometimes the questions are confusing, especially with the longer videos. Maybe on those, you could do a quiz that's inside the video so every 8 or 9 minutes it stops and asks a couple of questions about the material that was just covered.",somewhat easier,way less,1,4
"I like the style of the lecture. Each videos are short so it encourages students to learn rather than falling asleep in a 50mins long lecture video.

I have enjoyed lecture the most so far.

I’ve been enjoying the way lectures are posted on YouTube in a chunk of smaller videos instead of one long 50 minute video. ,"Sometimes I forget to do the quizzes, which is on me, but some days the quizzes will be worth only 6 points in total and other days it will be worth like 15 points in total, and we only have 20 free points. So if you forgot on a day where there’s not a lot of points, it’s fine, but if you forget on a day with a lot of points you could be using almost all your 20 free points on one day. I know it’s ideal that you don’t forget but it would make more sense if the quizzes were worth the same points every day. I wish there was the ability to take the quizzes up to a day late for a little bit of credit. It’s hard adjusting to online learning and I’m not used to remembering to have to take a quiz every other day. It’s different being in my home environment as opposed to being at school where I wouldn’t forget to go to lecture. I just feel like they’re not really equivalent and I wish there was some more leniency.",about as difficult,somewhat more,5,3

But believe if we were in a class setting and these questions were given as iclicker questions, we probably wouldn't be graded on them like we are now. I think if we were given multiple attempts for them we would be able to learn from our mistakes hence having the material stick in our heads better. ",about as difficult,about the same,3,4

"The lecture videos and corresponding quizzes. I really appreciate that the professor breaks up each topic into its own video, so if I am struggling with something I can just refer back to a quick video, rather than an entire hour-long lecture. Also, the Jupyter Notebooks included with the videos have been super helpful to see examples of exactly how to use the code to get desired results. I learn best by referring to these examples.","Working in a group project through zoom.

Developing our final project by finding an interesting question to explore and potential datasets that could help us answer the question.,"The coding assignments are my least favorite because of the fact that they implement hidden tests that you can't see so you have no way to telling if your code is entirely correct. I would perform the format where all of the tests are available to run and when we are finished with the assignment, we can see our final score based on what tests passed. In the real world, there are no hidden tests when we submit code so I don't really see a point to having hidden tests. ",somewhat easier,about the same,6,8

I'm also enjoying getting some more experience with Python.,"Some of the quiz questions have been frustrating. I watch the videos thoroughly, but of course I don't remember every detail since I learn a lot more effectively by doing assignments and projects. I will remember the broad concepts of the video, and will remember some specific and technical things that stand out to me, but will miss others. Anything that I miss, I then learn and actually remember once I use them in practice.

I don't personally care too much about the topics being taught in COGS 108 however what I was really impressed with is how much effort the TAs/Tutors and especially the professor is putting in.

I was really surprised because I think that was the first time I ever received a personalized response to one of the hundreds of surveys I've had to fill out.

Also the errors in editing you have sometimes are really funny as well.,"Definitely the quizzes.

I understand that you open up the quizzes the weekend before but a lot of the time I have another class that has priority for an assignment that's due Sun night, Mon night, etc. I believing something like having an extra day for the quizzes would help out a lot at times (Mon quizzes due Tue night, Wed due Thurs night, etc) as it would let me work on whatever I have to finish at the time and not have the COGS quiz in the back of my mind haunting me. One other thing for me personally is just having a little bit more time on some of the quizzes. I've always been a bit of a slow test taker and regarding these quizzes where sometimes the answer is one small thing mentioned in a 20 minute video I find myself going back and forward making sure I have the right answer and it eats up a lot of time for other questions.

Although as of right now most of the topics are stuff like data structures or concepts that I already have a grasp on, it's really improving my understanding on these things. As a math major, it's a very common occurrence for me to be able to do something programmatically, but not actually understand why it works.

-) I'm the type of person that likes to do assignments on one sitting and be done with it, so the video quizzes has been a bit of a hassle for me. I get that I can just finish the video assignments at the beginning of the week but it's a different kind of studying than doing the programming assignments, which is what I'm used to, if that makes sense.

However, I feel like (in my opinion), that there should be more flexibility when it comes to the quizzes. For example, in my opinion, there should be a little bit more time allotted for each question on the quiz, not 1 minute per question. I feel like allotting only one minute per question creates more pressure and its not enough time to come up with the correct answer or too look back at the notes to make sure/confirm the answer (especially when you accidentally missed something in the lectures). Also, allowing multiple attempts on the lecture quizzes could be nice too (without exposing the correct answers after taking it, of course), as this can make us look back at the lectures or lecture notes to see what we've missed and possibly got wrong.

Other than that though, no complaints :)",about as difficult,about the same,3,4
"It's application based. I think that is the most important thing. It's nice learning the theory behind it, but trying to come up with a project to apply our knowledge really helps us prepare for actual Data Science stuff.","I think the course is too spread out which causes the problem of too little attention for important topics. For example, while I was looking through the Linear Regression videos, I found that the videos did not nearly cover the detail required and that a lot of the important points were skimmed over too quickly. I have extensive experience in Statistics and in particular Linear Regression, but if I were a beginner who hadn't taken a college level Statistics course, I would really struggle to get all that detail in such a short space of time. To be clear, this isn't a criticism of teaching (Professor Ellis is one of the very best professors I've had the pleasure of learning from at UCSD), but one of time. I understand that quite a lot of topics need to be covered in this course, but perhaps the course can afford to lose some of the materials that are going to be covered to create time for future batches. 

Suggestion to fix this issue: After this quarter, the Professor will have a collection of videos which explain the topics really well. A possible solution is that some of the less engaging topics can be taught (say the earlier videos about Git and GitHub, some basic programming concepts such as pandas which students can easily pick up through online video and Jupyter Notebook Walkthroughs as well as by looking at the documentation available online) to the students via this medium while lecture time can be used for more engaging material (like going through the assumptions of Linear Regression and t-tests with more thoroughness and perhaps explaining the intuition behind those things, a full example of real-life data science projects etc).",way easier,somewhat less,0.5,3
