For example in A3 there's a question asking about ""By looking at the plot you just generated, approximately how many people in df do the data suggest took no steps?"" The figure shows about 1000 people in the bin near 0, however, by a closer look, the data is actually -1, which often indicates missing data.

Also, the assignment should focus more on data analysis as a data scientist, and less on some minor details of pandas and python.
