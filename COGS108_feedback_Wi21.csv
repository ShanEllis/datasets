"I enjoy about learning python. I think learning pandas package enable me to clean my data in more efficient way. Also, I achieve a better tool to express my data, when I learned data visualization.","I really did not enjoy learning ethnic part. Although I think it is a very important topic, I still think it is kind of boring. I am glad the rest lectures are amazing and engaging."
Mainly being able to explore the field of data science and tools to work with and analyze real data out there in the world. I think it's cool to be able to work with the data to be able to deduce interesting stats or facts that are not easily seen without tools.,"Since I have to say something I guess it'll be that it can be a little confusing to know what exactly the assignments are asking for in some questions, or what specific method it wants us to use and how."
Coding is funny,PDF lecture notes should be put on Canvas
"I enjoy the ease of access to assignments, for instance, completing assignments via DataHub and Canvas is very simple and convenient.","At first, I felt that the Data Ethics or Data Privacy sections were unnecessary. HOWEVER, I soon realized that they are valid concerns because neither I would like my data to be nonconsentially used and these are topics that are often undermined."
Learning pandas and plots,final project
Coding is funny,PDF lecture notes should be put on Canvas
Hand on experience and discussion about pandas and seaborn functions.,
I have enjoyed the case studies learning about interesting applications of Data Science.,"The pace, but I understand this is an introductory course, and I did take the course for this reason, so this is not a valid criticism."
Juypter Notebook,Discussion questions being vague
Applying skills from COGS18 to real-world scenarios such as experimenting.  My python skills are not being exercised.,"The difficulty of some packages such as pandas.  Some stuff feel harder than they should, like graphing."
"The process. It could be ugly at the start of a assignments, but it comes together and I learn the ins and outs through struggling and trial and error. ",The stress about it all. Thank Goodness there is no test involving executing code 
I enjoy learning Python and especially how I can apply that in my future career. It is a new programming language to me as I only know Java so far. But learning Python is helpful and I know more about how scientists can put the data together to answer questions.,I cannot think of anything that I like least about COGS 108. Everything seems good so far to me
"What I have enjoyed the most are the detailed responses from emails. The large amount of feedback is rare to see, and it makes it much easier to stay on the right track for the project.","This one is hard to say, but I think I least enjoy the discussion section assignments, mainly because the discussion section assignments together tend to take longer than the assignments, which is due to my lack of knowledge in Python, pandas, etc."
Love the lectures and the amount of information given during them. It does not seem like it's overwhelming. It feels like the perfect amount :) ,"Since I am still not so comfortable with coding, the assignments are still a bit overwhelming. "
Learning how to use pandas has been incredibly useful for other classes. ,The programming skill level varies too much in the class which makes group projects hit or miss. 
"I enjoyed learning using github, as well as data wrangling. ",
I have enjoyed the ethics lectures the most as I think the concepts are extremely important,in general its just hard for me to grasp coding concepts but thats not specific to this class
"I've enjoyed doing the A2 assignment because I thought that one was fairly easy to do, and it felt good when I understood how to write the code.","In terms of assignments, I didn't like D3. I wasn't able to extract the topics/code covered in lecture to complete D3 in an efficient way, and I struggled a lot on making the proportions, spending hours on it. "
"I like the hands-on experience I've been getting with Python in relation to its applications with data wrangling and data visualization designs. I feel like having so many opportunities for hands-on learning has really solidified the fundamentals of using Python to perform data analytics, and Prof. Ellis always offers clear, easy-to-understand instruction whenever getting us started on the basics.","Lecture examples for data visualization tended to be more simple than for the discussion lab, which resulted in quite some frustration compared to earlier experiences with discussion submissions. I understand that in the beginning of the quarter, we were already warned that we would need to do a lot of Googling (and honestly, I have no complaints about doing so, because I have found the overall research experience to be more enlightening than painstaking), but I feel like the class would have benefitted if more challenging examples had been included in the lecture.   "

"
"I've enjoyed learning Python and the overall organization of the course. I've been meaning to learn Python for a long time and it's nice to have the chance to both learn and apply it to assignments and projects. In terms of the organization, it's really nice that students know pretty much exactly what to expect week to week as it allows us to plan ahead in relation to other classes as well.",Working with my group has been a little frustrating given that we are all remote and disconnected. At times they can be quite unresponsive.
Hands on learning of seaborn and pandas. Also just the idea of fermi estimation (which I will now use for the rest of my life).,"Length and helpfulness of technical discussion sections. It would be more helpful if instead of going over previously written code (like the D3 Baby names), the TA's actually coded in Pandas/seaborn in front of us, this would help us see the process more clearly."
"I have most enjoyed the team aspect of COGS 108. As a computer science major, it is refreshing to be able to work with a larger team and be able to hear the thoughts and ideas of many other people. I like that this class revolves around such an interesting project where there is a large amount of flexibility, such as free choice of topic. ","I have least liked the timed quizzes that we must take each Friday. While they do encourage us to go over the material and solidify our understanding of the lectures, I think they shouldn't be timed as 15 minutes to take a quiz online can sometimes be stressful. "
"I'm really not a fan of the material, but I like how Prof Ellis walks us through the notebooks and how the coding stuff is explained very clearly. Having the explanations in the class notebooks makes doing the discussion labs and assignments a lot easier since I can usually check the class notebook and reliably find the code I need.","Again, I really am not interested in data science in general so it's been kind of hard to keep myself motivated for this class (especially when the COGS department won't let us P/NP like other departments have been doing, but that's a whole other can of worms...). But I don't have anything I dislike in particular about the way the course is run, and I'm grateful that even though there are quite a few small assignments every week, none of them feel like busy work and are actually helpful for me since I'm not as strong with coding."
"Professor is always a joy to have in the class, work is spaced out and not too difficult. ",Everything is doing great! 
the discussions and hw,this final project
"no midterms, i feel like i learn more from the assignments than i would a test",documentation on programming pandas can be difficult to apply to assignment
I have enjoyed learning how to incorporate coding into data analysis. ,I find that the discussions are quite long and can be rather tedious. I think shortening them to a more clear cut practice would serve to be better. 
"I have learned a new way to look at data, and had great fun doing research on our project. ","There are a lot of new terminologies and when I was doing technical discussion, a lot of stuff was barely covered in the class, hence it was a little bit stressful. "
"The group project. I think it is really productive and helpful to feel what group coordination would be like in the real world, like in a job or research prosition.","I think I would like discussions and Assignments to be combined, because to me it feels like there are too many different things due to keep track of."
"The class rhythm is good for me and because there is no midterm and final, it gives me more time to figure out what's the meaning behind each question. I think I can learn more in this way.",Discussion 3 is somewhat difficult for me. There is one question taking me about 2 hours but I still miss it.
I liked exploring ways to represent different visualizations using same dataset and the importance of ethics in data science was intriguing too.,D3 was too hard to complete as it did not have much guidance given that it is supposed to help us with assignments. A2 was way easier than D3.
"I enjoyed learning about the different data files, such as CSV, JSON files, and learning about how to use pandas to create different datasets and tables.","I least enjoyed the actual coding and programming aspects of using pandas, as it can get a little confusing learning the syntax and code."
"I like the structure of the class and how we work in teams. It makes me feel less stressed in knowing that I have a team to collaborate with this quarter instead of having to do a huge project on my own. I think that even though its through zoom, it offers students the ability to chat and get to know each other in a time where that is limited not only in our social and personal lives but also in school work. I think its a nice break and overall makes me feel more confident in the class.",The thing I like the least is probably having so many things due on Fridays. It bunches up for me and its managable but it wouldnt have been my preference to have everything due on one day. But maybe having 2/3 due on friday and one due on saturday or sunday since I work during the week and the weekend has more study and homework time for me.
I have enjoyed the learning of python. I can now easily use this language to analyze data.,"I know that the ethics are important for data analysis, but it is kind of boring. Also, I am so confused that I missed some points in every quiz."
"I enjoy learning the python library pandas. I know it is an important skill for data analyze, it is worth to learn in this class since it will be more helpful for my future career!",Every topics are interesting! No liked LEAST so far in this class.
"I enjoy doing the assignments, it is pretty difficult with no python experience and I am also not great at coding, so it does take a lot of time, but figuring out the code when I’m stuck can be fun sometimes. ",I think doing a group project makes this class a little difficult because it’s hard to find time for the group to meet because everyone has very conflicting schedules. 
"Learning about pandas, it is very interesting","Early lecture, not a morning person lol"
"The class is very structured and despite having many assignments, they're all due on Friday every week, so it's easy to remember. ","I honestly don't like that I have to work in a group of four, but at least I get more experience with collaboration :)"
Learning about ethics in COGS 108 was really interesting for me but I am biased because I love when ethics are involved in anything,"Coding as always been hard for me and this class is no different, so as coding gets more complicated I have to spend more and more time on this class and it ends up being the most difficult and time consuming. "
I liked learning to do different types of plots using seaborn/matplotlib/pandas,"Everything is good, it's just hard to get up at 9 in the morning :)"
The lecture and homework structure is super clear.,Remote learning makes the group communication a little harder than usual.
A lot of resources; reasonable amount of workload. ,It'd be great if we spent more time talking about python 
"The content of the course is really helpful, and I think I actually learn something about how to apply data science.","Actually there is nothing I do not like, this course is great."
"The thing I have enjoyed MOST about COGS 108 so far is working on the group project. During this time of remote learning, I believe things like group projects help people feel less isolated and give students an opportunity to better connect with their peers.","The thing I liked LEAST about COGS 108 so far is learning about all the different things that can be done in pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. I'm overwhelmed by how many different things can be done and don't think I can remember everything we go over in lecture."
I like working with a team and learning from other team members.,Plotting graphs is hard.
I like the pace of lecture and assignments. It's almost a perfect balance of being able to learn a lot at an optimal level without having excessive stress.,"The Discussion notebooks are sometimes confusing from the lack of instructions on the notebook itself, but through lectures and research they are doable."
I enjoy the option to watch the lectures asynchronously such that I can watch the lectures at my own pace and pause when I need to.,I find the assignments to be a little challenging and could take some time to complete with no prior python knowledge.
The professor's lectures are very engaging.,The Discussion problems are sometimes unclear or cover material that has not yet been taught.
I've enjoyed working with my group towards the final project since it seems very interesting how we can work on our own real data science project. ,Sometimes I find the Discussion assignments and the actual assignments difficult to do and stressful and I feel like I do not have enough knowledge from the class lectures to be able to answer the questions.
"I have been enjoying the teaching style! Professor Ellis has been very engaging in the way she has explained concepts, and has given very clear answers to questions.","This is less of a dislike, and more of me being bad at the utilization of python, pandas and other imports. It has gotten easier (likely due to previous experience with java) though, so it is not that bad!"
I think what I enjoy most is that we're able to apply concepts taught in class towards a project. It gives us more experience through hands-on learning. I also like the fact that we have discussion labs that help with future assignments.,"What I like least is just that there's never a right or wrong answer in some instances. I guess this could be a good thing, but in some cases I find myself doing a lot of outside research to understand something new that I have to learn to apply."
"My favorite part so far is going to the lectures, bc Professor Ellis is really passionate about Data Science and I like learning about how to conduct research and do data analyses, etc. ","I am not a fan of coding and am a beginner Python learner, which do not go well together. I have had to look basically everything up for the Discussion and normal Assignments, so it has been sometimes very frustrating and time-consuming, even when I do go to office hours/section for help."
Enjoyable subject matter and assignments,N/A
This is a nice extension to 18 for me to learn about visualizing data instead of just the programming aspects of python.,"The data visualization teaching portion could use some work. I really struggled with D3 on how to wrangle the data into a usable format to display. I attended lectures and you went over some of it but it was nowhere near enough for the discussion lab. I also attended two different TA's office hours but neither was able to help too much. They both seemed just as lost as I was with the errors I encountered and were unable to effectively guide me on alternate strategies. If the time spent teaching data-wrangling strategies was increased before dropping us into the lab or more guide rails were added to the lab to help us, that would make the experience much better as our support structure wasn't able to prop us up and google isn't particularly helpful as the error messages are very generic and nondescriptive of the true nature of the error."
I really enjoy the labs. They teach me the practical python skills that other classes won't.,Class is too early
"I have enjoyed brushing up on my pandas and matplotlib skills, plus learning about seaborn",N/A
"So far, the most I have enjoyed about COGS 108 is being able to finally work with data. I have for so long wondered what exactly Data Science consists of, and being able to have hands on experience with organizing and analyzing data has given me confidence that I'll be able to employ these skills at future tech jobs. I enjoy the assignments that make sure I keep my practice up and it's honestly so exciting whenever I get a cell to run. I'm very excited for this class, and I've already had employers ask about this course while interviewing for internships, and they've shown great interest in the knowledge I'm gaining from it! 

I have also thoroughly enjoyed the group work and my team mates are all amazing. It's been tough not being on campus, so it's nice to communicate with students through group projects.","The least I've liked about COGS 108 is just realizing just how much memorization is required in cleaning, wrangling, and visualizing data. I'm not only trying to memorize the syntax for Python, but I'm also struggling with remembering what functions to call in pandas and how to correctly type out the operation I want. I spent 3 hours trying to google how to run just one cell and I still never figured it out. It is quite a lot to keep track of and I know the only way to get better is practice practice practice! No matter what though, I'm super excited to be learning these tools and it's great to know that this knowledge will be useful for me in the long run! 

Also, the quizzes are not my favorite. I have watched the lecture videos twice sometimes and I still cannot get full points on the quizzes."
Learning how to use Python,Learning how to use Python
Getting to understand more about how visualizations are created. I didn't understand how complicated the code could be for creating visualizations from a data frame. ,"Because I live in a different time zone and have a tight schedule for when I can watch friday lecture, it is difficult for me to apply things that are mentioned in friday lecture to my assignments/group project. It would be nice if most of the tips and advice could be concentrated into monday and wednesday lecture. But all in all it's been really great, this is very minute :)"
I enjoy going to and watching the lectures. The way you teach and bring positive energy for an early class makes me want to be there and learn. I also love how you read out the questions in the chat before answering them because it makes it easier for me to review when rewatching the lecture videos.,"I’m still working on adjusting to GitHub since I haven’t had prior experience with it, so having it as a vital part of the course is a little challenging."
I really enjoyed learning new knowledge about Python and having chance collaborate with other students,"I don't really like the weakly quiz, although it's not really hard, but i still would miss 1 or 2 points on weekly quizzes"
"I have liked the lectures a lot, as even though some of the information is confusing, I am often engaged.","I do not like the assignments, due to my difficulty with them on my own."
"The class lectures, overall i like the format of the course lectures since it feels really well explained for the content and the format makes it easy for me to understand (even if I am participating A-sych).","The group project, this is because although I understand it is necessary of an experience for the future, it is still difficult to manage a project all online, while still trying to be understanding of other group-mate's personal situations and responsibilities."
I have really liked the datahub assignments. It really allows me to learn by using trial-and-error to work through problems.,I don't really like the weekly quizzes. I feel like they don't accurately assess what I have learned from that week.
The content has been very useful.,It's difficult to learn and apply a lot of the topics we've learned in class to our projects due to the fast-paced nature of the class. 
Applications of concepts to code,Lecture talking speed a little too fast
The discussion labs because they allow me to practice things before assignments with little pressure.,The quizzes just seem like busywork. I think the assignments help my learning significantly more because actively doing something helps me learn better than taking quizzes.
I think the lecture is pretty fun and interesting and the data visualization is enjoyable sometimes.,I think the quizzes are pretty stressful for me each week even though I watches each lecture on time.
"Nothing at the moment (and I mean that in a non offensive way), but I'm hoping that working on this group project might be something I end up finding interesting. This might be the downside of this class being online.","Not a huge fan of the assignments, I feel like I know the gist of what I have to do but then I do it and it ends up being wrong! I think i'm just not that confident with python so was hoping for a little more guidance."
I enjoy the content of this course a lot! I'm really excited to have the opportunity to work on a project with team members as this is one of my first project based classes. I also really enjoy the research and data analysis of this course because I think it is a valuable experience. ,"I don't necessarily have anything that I like the least. I feel like I personally do a lot more googling in this class than I have had to in cogs 18. However, I believe it's because this class is less oriented in learning about code and more about doing actual data science. "
Think I enjoyed making plots with seaborne cause I'm visual learner and I like visual representation,"Figuring out how to graph was pretty hard. I kept getting errors with the parameters in seaborn. For example, I would try to pass something into the column but it would be the wrong column so my graph would look weird. Once I did figure it out though, it was very nice to see but the steps before are very frustrating."
Meeting interesting classmates,The coding. The prerequisite for this class is one python class (which I took) and I feel wholly unprepared for the material in this class.
"I was hesitant/apprehensive about remote group projects, not being able to meet in-person, but I have ended up enjoying working with others. This is definitely not something I would have done out of my own volition, so I am glad this class has gotten me to do it.","Dealing with the submission system on DataHub. I wish there were more confirmations/acknowledgement of my submission that would give me more confidence that my work has been submitted successfully, currently there is little user feedback."
I enjoyed working on the group project. It's an awesome chance to apply what we learned in class on a project we're interested in.,Homework
I've enjoyed being able to watch and stay caught up with lectures on my own time. I also really like the exploratory nature of the discussions because they allow me to test where I'm at and also see where I can afford to expand my knowledge without confusing myself.,"Honestly, I've got nothing for this! Thanks for a great quarter so far (:"
The topics are interesting.,The homework is a little overload.
the assignments allow you to learn things and figure them out,the discussions can be hard and the quizzes as well. Sometimes lectures don't really explain concepts introduced in the assignments or discussions too well. There are a lot of assignments due each week.
Working in a group! I havent worked in a group in a long time.,"Nothing, I like everything about the class so far"
Group project leads opportunities to talk to peers.,Keep procrastinating watching lectures led to more to watch...
learning how to write code for the various assignments,the bugs I run into while trying to code for the hmw and trying to figure those things out
Definitely been enjoying using Pandas and NumPy (useful skills esp for data science),"Mm, nothing much. Maybe do more backflips during lecture? I'm just kidding, I'm thoroughly enjoying this course. "
The assignment due on the same day. I will not miss any due.,The office hour is hard to reach since I am at different time zone.
"I really liked the group project, working together with a group on a insightful topic of our interests, and being able to really apply the analysis skills we learnt from classes to some real world questions.",
"I've really enjoyed the group project structure, and getting to interact with other students even if its remotely through zoom computer screens","I've gotten frustrated with myself a couple times with either an assignment or workbook, but I know that's just what comes with being new to a programming language"
I love the way we could work on a project to promote learning,"Sometimes I have hard time with assignment and labs, they are a little difficult to me"
Learning about pandas and different things to do with data.,"Fixing technical errors with Jupyter notebooks and Github, git controls"
"I enjoy learning so many codes, I am now really comfortable in python.","I still think that the ethics are a little bit boring, although they are important."
Learning about how to manipulate data has been fun,"I'm not sure if it's by design, but I feel like I don't know enough about how to use pandas, seaborn, etc., by the end of lectures, and end up spending a lot of time on discussion labs and assignments. (Maybe the lecture is for the theory and labs are for application?)"
"While looking for an idea for the project proposal, I was looking through the previous projects for inspiration. I found a lot of the projects interesting and how they were able to ask insightful questions and answer them using data science. ",The coding aspect of this course is by far the hardest and most frustrating thing of this course.  
"I've had a lot of fun working on the project review and project proposal with my teammates. All of our team members try to contribute and give their opinions, which was great. I also enjoyed going to live lectures or watching the recorded lectures. The topics are interesting and I like how everything is explained nicely so that we can easily understand everything.","The thing I liked the least is doing Discussion labs and assignments. I know they are supposed to help me practice so that I can do better for my project, but I felt like what we need to do for the labs and assignment are much more harder/advanced than what we learned in class. I had a really hard time trying to figure out D3. I tried watching technical discussion recording, going to a technical discussion, and going to the project discussion (I was waiting in the waiting room but ended up leaving because of my other schedule), but I wasn't able to get enough help / get enough idea on how to do some parts of D3."
assignments and discussion,maybe the quiz
After finished the assignment or lab it the most enjoyable time I have in COGS 108,"The process of creating our project topic, it is so hard and our team spend so many time thinking our topic. "
"I like how Professor Ellis goes through the notebook in class and we are able to follow along, so I guess it's the format of the Jupyter notebooks that allows this. Also, the fact that she goes through all the cells in lecture is helpful. ","It's pretty fast paced and I haven't worked too much with Python before so it's a little difficult, but not unbearable. "
The assignments have been really fun. In my classes thus far as a CS major I don't really recall the last time I had fun throughout the process of a programming assignment. Moreso it has just been a rush of adrenaline when finishing a lab but for this class it's fun throughout.,"Rather than being something I dislike, it is overwhelming having more than one technology (Pandas & Seaborn) but that's normal. It's a lot more self-study than I expected."
Being able to approach the project with my group so far,"Waking up at 9am, quizzes because I keep getting 1 or so questions wrong"
I've enjoyed working on a long-term project that feels like something I created.,"Much of the assignments feel like information I've been taught in previous classes such as basic pandas, but I understand that that is probably necessary for many students."
I have most enjoyed being able to actually do data science related tasks.,What I have liked least is the stuff to do with github because I am not familiar with it so it is still a little confusing. 
The assignments are a good look into Pandas,Finding the data for our project
"The lectures in datahub, they are very clear and a good review of Python information while explaining why certain choices are made for analysis","The discussion assignments, I often feel like they are harder than the actual assignments and it's hard to prioritize discussion assignments when they aren't mandatory/I don't have time in the week to work on it for a few hours"
"Learning how to apply Python to Data Science. I previously took COGS 18 to learn the basics, but it's been really fun to learn how to apply it to data science problems.",Finding a question with my group was really hard :((
The office hours and the study environments since we have multiple resource to ask for help or questions.,The assignment because it is kind of a lot and hard for me since I don't have much python experiences before.
Learning about the possible research questions we can answer using data science,Assignments
Being able to do the final project a group. It really helps being able to bounce ideas off 3-4 other people.,I don't like the discussion assignments. I have a really hard time trying to figure out how to do them even after office hours.
learning about various python libraries; I have a lot of experience in Python but never delved into the basic usage of these useful libraries.,"I feel like the D# (D1, D2, etc) should be more basic/ tutorial style, because the only point of these are to teach and help understand rather than test knowledge (like the A# and Q# should). If the D# had more hints or more explicit about how to solve the problem, that would be extremely helpful. "
"I enjoyed recapping on Python, which I taught myself using online resources during high school. I also enjoyed learning how to get going on the data science project.","As I am pretty unfamiliar with pandas, the discussions have been a bit harder for me, but this may also be due to the fact that I'm not able to access the discussion recordings."
"Getting to make data visualizations! I've only really ever done something similar to it when I took AP Statistics in high school and would run statistical graphs on my TI-nspire software, but nothing as interactive and fun as making the visualizations for discussion labs and assignments.","Although I enjoy making the visualizations, I don't have a strong foundation in python or programming skills, so it has been frustrating getting used to the syntax, processes and general logistics of it. "
"The thing I have enjoyed the most about COGS 108 is the lectures and material we have covered in class, because it is throughly explained and easy to conceptualize.",The thing I liked the least is having to coordinate group times with everyone because it is a bit challenging to coordinate times virtually.
Learning and trying code out in datahub and seeing how the code changes data. It is cool to see how edits in code can manipulate data tables.,"The weight of each assignment and components of the project are stressful and overwhelming because they are worth a significant percent of my grade and unlike discussions and quizzes, it hard to be assured that I did it well and/or get quick feedback."
I enjoy the lectures the most. Professor is prepared and delivers very informative materials in a fun way. A good start for my mornings.,"I like quizzes the least. They are good markers to make sure students are on track with the materials but the questions require more thinking. So, I stress on them a bit more than I should for a check up assignment."
The project is the most fun and greatest learning experience thus far,"I prefer piazza to CampusWire, but I am slowly getting the hang of it"
The assignments,trying to find a group 
So far I have enjoyed learning about Pandas and how to use it in conjunction with data. It is my first time taking a data science course so I had no familiarity with the package beforehand so it has been interesting to learn how effective it is in reading data and processing it in analytical way.,I have not enjoyed the quizzes too much as I feel it would be better if we could earn back the points we lose in some way. This is due to some earlier quizzes having trickier questions but it is reasonable as the loss isn't too large. The quiz questions are fine as they do just ask largely about things one should know straight from lecture notes and recordings.
I’ve most enjoyed the lectures. Dr Ellis is a very engaging professor!,"I have disliked the fact that a lot of technical code related things are glossed over — even after having taken cogs 18 it really feels like this is a class meant for CS majors. Given that it’s a cogs major requirement, I think catering more to cogs majors makes sense. "
Lectures are not boring. ,loss of direction for final project 
Getting to work on data project with groups on the topic that we are interested in,"Using pandas and discussion homeworks (im really glad that its not graded based on our correction, but some questions are a little tough for me to solve)"
Learning how to handle data through Python libraries.,Need to memorize lots of syntax due to having to deal with different libraries.
Meeting my team.,The arbitrary grading of the project.
I love Ellis's teaching style. She's very clear in her speaking and thought and is very responsive to the comments. ,"Not that I liked the least, but the fact that I have already learned the materials in previous classes makes COGS 108 more like a review session."
"I learn a lot on python, it is find of fun at the beginning.","but also getting so much harder at the last couple week. I have spent a lot of time to do the assignment, I have lost passion and cry a lot during the assignment."
Learning pandas ,Thinking project proposal
Professor Ellis's lectures,the homework and discussion assignments and group work
I enjoyed that there are many extra resources and materials provided by the course github page.,"The thing I liked least about this course is that although there are many office hours hosted by TA, IA, and professor. It would be more helpful and convenient if there are more hours every day. "
I have enjoyed the assignments because I have been able to practice my skills with some cool real world examples.,
I enjoy how interactive the discussions and homework are.  I feel like the ideas that are taught in lecture are immediately enforced with the discussion assignments and homework.  It helps to retain the information in a low stake manner.,"Something that I feel is a blessing and curse is the openness of the project.  It was hard for my group to come up with something original and interesting, and it could have been nice to have some direction.  I appreciate this as well however, as it gives us the ability to explore anything we want."
"Having many chances to practice (projects, assignments, discussions)",Not knowing the statistics theory well (deep reasoning behind different plotting methods)
I really enjoyed using models we learned to visualize data. ,"Well, as a student in dsc major, I'm quite well with python. However, I have to check pandas documentation each time I use pandas. I know it's a painful growing period. But worth it, pandas is a really important package in python. "
the group project. So I get to meet people and make friends with my groupmates.,the coding is hard. I need to google tons of information to answer the questions. 
The lectures. Learning to conduct a data science research is pretty cool.,"The multiple deadlines coming on every Friday. It is convenient for sure, but it can be overwhelming in busy weeks. "
"Incorporation of course material into jupyter notebook and github, which allows me to practice using those tools while studying the course. ","Probably more tutorial on github will help because I was less exposed to the site before. When we were working on the project proposal, cloning and commiting the template from github onto jupyter notebook was a bit confusing for me and took some time to work it out. "
learn to use seaborn to plot visualizations for dataset,Nothing!
I enjoyed what I could learn from this course because I feel like all the things that I am learning now are not so challenging to me and those things will definitely be helpful in the future.,"Things I need to do for this course every week is too separated (Quiz, Assignment, Discussion work, group work) so I have to think about all those kinds of assignments about whether I have finished them or not."
learning different method and information about data analysis,Having difficulties on finding the best data for project
Dataframes are pretty cool,Creating the charts. Those functions are quite annoying since they don't have a standard format.
"I enjoy the assignments the most, since I learned pandas before but was unfamiliar with the syntax, so I picked up the syntax while doing the assignment.","I think some of the assignment description could be more clear, thank you."
chill people. noice professor.,no?
"I've enjoyed how visually understanding the lectures are, they are easy to follow which makes the class less daunting. (Also, the energy of the class!)","I hope that in future lectures, they are more guiding toward the assignments and discussion labs since its hard to know where to start on some problems without guidance. "
"assignment and lecture, learned alot from the lecture,and use it on our assignment is fun.","project,   people in different time zone is the problem that we cannot or hard for us to planning a time to meet sometimes."
Looking all those data become organized is so fun!,Not really everything is pretty find
"The asynchronous nature of the class, it is easy for me to be flexible around when I can do work for this class during the week, and allows leniency for other classwork.",Its a little hard to do self-study on how to use certain modules.
"I love the exploration of ethics and statistics that we have engaged in. It’s really important to make clear that ethical usage of data needs to be a priority. Tying data science with its statistical roots also helps me grasp the Python implementation of statistical analysis that we perform in this class, even if it’s currently limited to descriptive statistics and representation. ","There is a major Python difficulty spike from COGS 18 that I was not prepared for. This could be from a lack of preparation on my part. However, I performed exceptionally well in COGS 18, and I am struggling quite more than anticipated with regards to programming in this course. Getting adjusted to GitHub is also proving difficult, at least with regards to utilizing Terminal. "
Learning about how to manage different data.,"Trying to figure out how to work with different python libraries (pd, sns, np, mpl) to get things to work."
"I  like how the discussion labs are graded on effort. Sometimes I can't figure out the correct methods to use, so it's less stressful.","Probably having to work on a group project. I don't have issues with my group, but group projects make me uneasy sometimes. "
seeing real life applications to the concepts we're learning about (i enjoyed the candy data set in A2!),discussion assignments are tedious and sometimes harder than the actual assignments themselves 
So far I enjoy learning from the assignments. I think they're applicable and are helpful in terms of the material.,I'm stressed out about the project. I really don't have the programming comfort to be a huge help. I honestly feel really useless on my team
"Coding Assignments, because its been my first experience with python and i have found it interesting so far",Nothing so far
"How the class is organized, ie I like how the Discussion slides are graded based on completion rather than correctness so that it makes it less stressful",Nothing blatant comes to mind
I've enjoyed going through the discussion notebooks and the assignments. I thought they were a good review for the concepts and processes that I've previously learned in DSC classes.,"For me personally, it has been the pace of the class. I understand that it's hard to accommodate everyone, especially since the class has a wide variety of majors and programming experience. I just feel like the class has been moving a bit too slowly. I would also like to have more instructions on the process of creating a data science project from scratch since that is a big portion of the class."
the assignments. working with data is actually quite fun. really looking forward to the group project,there isn't anything in particular. the class has been going great for me so far
"I've enjoyed learning about pandas, seaborn, and data visualizations I never knew we could do in python. I've been learning a lot so far.","Something I've liked least about Cogs 108 could be that the discussion labs are a little long, but that's okay."
"I like being able to work in a group, especially during covid ",The workload is kind of a lot and the material definitely isn't easy
Lecture is most I enjoyed. I likes how you use example to explain those technical  things.,Anything is good
The coding as I like Jupyter Notebok.,The different graph. 
I have enjoyed learning the essentials to becoming comfortable coding with Python.,The assignment deadlines are lining up with other class assignment deadlines but that is all. 
Getting to do some hands-on Pandas stuff in smaller doses with the discussion notebooks.,"The fact that we have to come up with the project proposal (which essentially also means already having a particular dataset, etc in mind preemptively) before we've learned much about the type of analysis we'll be doing."
I have liked how topics are discussed in lecture in a clear and organized manner. I also like all the project deadlines to keep us on track and that it is all spaced out ,I don't really understand lecture since it's usually large blocks of code and we go through them quickly rather than breaking down each code line. I also don't like how most of the topics in discussion lab are not in lecture and I feel like I have to google most of it to understand. 
"I've really enjoyed getting to experiment with dataframes, and the idea of learning modules like pandas, matplotlib, and numpy,","Learning these modules is real confusing... Like I understand a good amount of python, but I can't wrap my head around the data manipulations and plotting stuff. Still feel like I need a ton more help and it's making me very stressed about making progress on my project, since there's so much I want to do but I just can't because I don't know how to go about starting."
It has been fun working in python given that it's a new language to me; I have enjoyed learning the new syntax and am enjoying the simplicity (and dynamic typing) in python.,"Lecture can be a little dense/fast sometimes. Occasionally, professor will take time and carefully express how a certain function works and gives multiple examples of different uses; other times she breezes through a function and gives a general idea of how it works, this results in many students (at least the ones I have communicated with) investing a large sum of time figuring out how to use certain functions during each and every assignment so far."
I enjoy the data visualization,Vaguely worded options in quizzes
Constantly learning new materials on Python and Pandas. There's so much to data science and computer science I don't know about. Having a glimpse into the two worlds is quite intriguing and eye-opening. ,"The materials are getting scarier by lecture. The amount of new stuff is a little overwhelming to me, especially when applying them in the discussion labs and upcoming assignments, as well as for the final project. I worry that my performance won't be as satisfactory as I'd hope. It's also extremely time consuming to me because of my limited knowledge, but whenever I get it it's the best feeling."
I enjoy working with python,the coding aspect is a lil overwhelming 
The lectures are very chill and not too intense material. The class is very decently paced including assignments and due dates.,Sometimes I feel like quiz material is not covered in the lectures or is very detailed so it's hard to remember. I take notes on majority of the content and sometimes I still can't recall/find it.
I've learned new data science techniques that seem to be pretty useful skill to have in my repertoire as an EE student. ,"Some of the discussion labs were very challenging for someone with essentially no experience with the analysis packages, also Assignment 2 was due after Lab 3, but lab 3 required skills learned from assignment 2 which was confusing."
"I really like getting more experience with pandas and the data visualization packages. I'm going to have to use both (and R) in my work when I graduate, so it's good to be learning them now.","I understand their purpose, but the weekly quizzes give me anxiety because some of the answers seem finicky and subjective. I wish there was some kind of replacement for these (I know clicker questions were that replacement when classes were in person)."
clear explanation on concepts,"Assignment is too straight forward (solutions are almost given), maybe having weekly problem set without specific approach would better promote self-learning."
I enjoy learning a lot about data science because it is a new subject to me since I am a math-cs major. ,I think the least I like about this class is that there's a lot of coding but not too much detail on how to do it. I often find myself looking up how to use functions in order to complete the discussion labs and assignments. 
Flexibility with deadlines and assignments along with how everything we need to know is covered in lecture!,"Having to use GitHub for our project proposal was a little difficult since every little comma matters for the full file to load, but once we got over that, it was perfectly fine!!"
To try to find ways of solving actual research questions through coding and do peer review of projects that were done by previous groups,"To learn coding. I'm not very good at it. Thus, I always need extra time trying to figure them out. But once I figured something out, it was always satifying. "
The thing I enjoy most is being able to create our own project and work with others in a group. I think that it's really important to learn to work with other people for big and important projects because it helps to prep us for our futures where we aren't just working alone on everything. It's also really enjoyable that I can work with other people because remote learning can be very boring while staying at home all day. ,"Overall I really enjoy the class but what I think the thing I like the least has more to do with coding than it actually has to do with the class. I've taken a bunch of CS courses before this class but I think pandas in general just irritates me because I'm so unused to it. I understand how to solve the problems and what the end goal should be, but I find that it can be really annoying without knowing the right code to use along with not knowing what exactly to look up when I'm stuck."
Datahub/Jupyter having never used it before; it is nice to learn and do the homework as I progress.,Probably the discussions as they are sometimes ambiguous and I'm unsure of what to put in for my answers sometimes.
I have enjoyed the structure of the material and the way lectures have been carried the most. I do feel like there is good explanations and care for the students' learning.,I have liked the least working with GitHub. This is more of a personal issue because it is my first time using it and I am very unfamiliar. I understand the terms and what I am supposed to do but get confused on how to carry out what I want to.
I enjoyed learning how data relates to the real world and being able to understand data better. I enjoyed the real life examples talked about in class. ,The lecture quizzes because at the end of the week I forget about the small details mentioned in class so I have to rewatch everything to pick up anything missing. 
I enjoyed learning more applications of Python. I think it will be very beneficial to me later on in my life,The discussion quizzes. I feel like they are a bit harder than the HW
Hands-on Data Science project - actually get to learn on the go,Difficult to get a hang of syntax etc for discussion assignments.
"I enjoyed the lectures and assignments from COGS 108 so far. The assignments are very helpful in understanding lecture material, and I enjoy that it goes more in depth with certain topics, forcing you to look up the manual of methods and such for pandas, seaborn, etc. I also enjoy the lectures in how they are very concise and straight to the point on information, which makes it easier to take in the material when viewing the lecture.","I've liked the discussion labs the least, but that does not mean I don't enjoy them. I feel that they vary in difficulty too much and are quite unclear on what's exactly wanted, which makes them less enjoyable compared to the assignments. A suggestion from me would be to make the instructions slightly more clear on what's wanted, and I believe that will make the labs more enjoyable."
"What I have enjoyed most about COGS 108 is using Jupyter Notebook. By using different libraries on Jupyter Notebook, I have become more familiar with the datasets and learned some sense of analyzing it!",Discussions and Assignments are quite challenging. It would be beneficial for us to take more time learning programming rather than logics.
I really enjoy learning the technical skills we've been learning especially with pandas in python. I had taken DSC10 before but we were using a different version of pandas and it's been really interesting+challenging learning how to use pandas and applying it to the project.,There's nothing I disliked about COGS108 thus far. The only thing I could nitpick would be that the assignment and labs can be a bit difficult at times if you don't show up to the lab sections. 
The data visualization part is really useful,Homework is a little bit hard (datahub); still very worried about the final project since we think our proposal is not good and it is difficult to find data that we want and determine our research question
"I've enjoyed learning more about the pandas package. In cogs 18, we just briefly went over it and at that time, it didn't seem like it could do much. However, just by going over A2, it really is a powerful tool and it was interesting to me to see how lines of code could result in visual images such as graphs and that there are multiple ways to change the graph to fit my image. ","If I had to pick, the part I've liked the least about COGS 108 was when we had to conceptually learn about github, privacy, ect. I like the coding aspect of this class more than the conceptual one so it was harder for me to focus on the concepts. On the other hand, I do recognize that they are important so I knew they were necessary to learn. "
The class is interesting and teaches us useful skills of data analyze,The teach speaks a little too fast
I liked learning about pandas and other libraries.,"minimal instructions in discussions. I liked how A2 guides you and you learn a lot, whereas discussion is just less vague and you don't really know where to start if you're stuck."
I like how we think of our own ways to apply what we learn in a project,"however, sometimes working with a group needs way more effort"
"When we learn data visualization, it is fun to see how the codes related to the graph it created.","Not about the course but python itself, it was kinda confusing and hard to understand the logic at first since I have not learned it before this course, and it is pretty different from the languages I am familiar with (C++, java)."
I enjoy learning how to wrangling the data and use it to solve real problems.,The incovinient caused by online courses make it difficult to communicate with group members.
It is fun to develop my python skill. ,There are some quiz problem that prof just mentioned ambiguously on class and I think it should be some more technical problem.
How everything due each week is due on Friday and that theres a slide saying what is due on Friday.,Not getting feedback for our project idea sooner.
The lectures! I really wish I took this class when I was learning pandas. My old classes told us to learn by reading the documentation. And including misc-related things like the Fermi problem I LOVED. I also love how structured the class is and how assignments can be validated through datahub. I wish my DSC classes also did this.,Nothing. I am having a blast. Thank you
I enjoyed doing the discussion labs and assignments. I like learned about how to use data and analysis the figures that come from data.,"I don't like waking up early in the morning for lecture, but I have to because I liked being in lecture live."
learning to use Pandas,I want to learn more on how to use Github because I am still not comfortable using them.
Using and learning more about Jupyter Notebooks. I haven't used it since my DSC10 class and it is just so fascinating how much more efficient and convenient it is than using a text editor such as atom. ,"I definitely have struggled a little with the discussion labs - the assignments are fine because the instruction is detailed, but even after watching the discussions I can't figure a lot out. This is also the first very hands on course I've had at UCSD with doing my own research so it has been hard believing in myself and my abilities when it is something out of my comfort zone that I don't have experience with. But nonetheless I am very excited to get more involved in this class!"
"The lectures, easy to follow",Groups
The class is very organized and structured well to give students both enough flexibility and challenges to adjust their workload for the class appropriately each week.,Lectures go a little fast.
"I have loved working on the COGS108 discussion and assignment notebooks. Working with real data and coming up with an analysis on the data is satisfying for me personally. Additionally, I have enjoyed the collaborative aspect of the project and being able to interact with other people while working remotely.","Knowing that COGS 108 was an intro to data science, I knew that we were going to be going really fast through some of the topics. I would love to have spent more time going over pandas syntax and tools and tips for effective data wrangling."
Learning how to do things in python in a structured and easy way,The consistent amount of assignments
"The lectures focus on material that is relevant for assignments/labs. In some classes, the professor doesn't discuss the concepts we need to use on homework. This has not been the case in Cogs 108.","That it's at 9am! ;) On a serious note, there isn't anything I haven't liked about Cogs 108 so far"
"Lecture content is being taught well with good pacing, professor knows what she's doing. ",Working in groups. Very hard to coordinate meeting together. Not easy being productive on a large group project when being remote. 
"The lectures have been really interesting, and I have enjoyed them a lot.",I wish we had a midterm of sorts to synthesize the content so far
"working with my group, gradually working through the project",somehow I don't have any particular thing that I've liked the least
I like working with datasets,"The discussion labs, I feel like they just are a simplified version of assignments which don't necessarily add anything to my skillset"
"Watching recorded videos, and being able to generate the plots and arrive at the right result.",Discussion labs are a little bit harder than expected. I spent a lot of time on doing them.
"Learning more python, seeing concepts learned in cogs 18 expanded on for more practical applications.",The documentation for PANDAS sucks.
I enjoy that we learn about a variety of topics really quickly! I feel like I'm learning a lot in just a few weeks.,"So far the discussions take me significantly longer than the assignments. I wish I had learned all of the syntax that I need for discussions either in lecture or in a discussion guide, as most of the times I have to Google everything which takes a while depending on if I know what I'm looking for."
communication with groupmates ,I have liked least about COGS108 assignments and discussion labs because most of them are not covered during the lectures. 
Learning the theory behind data visualization. It's something that I didn't really give too much thought about til we learned more in class. I think it's really interesting that there's so much that goes into it. ,Mainly scared for finding datasets for our question and thinking that we should slightly modify our question based off this weeks lecture. I sorta think ours is a little vague and could be specified. 
Going through the experience of working on a data science project as part of a team.,The struggles and challenges of working as a team.
Learning about the different aspects of data science,Nothing really course is not as high stress but more learning involved which is good. Maybe more lecture notes describing content in detail
I have enjoyed going over how to better use visualization tools in order to show particular data.,"I don't like using many different platforms,  so campuswire is a bit annoying for me. I've never understood why we need canvas/piazza/campuswire/etc."
"Data wrangling has actually been quite interesting. I struggled at first, but after a while it has started to become fun to figure out ways to extract the data I want and then to have a visual for it.","Sometimes I feel lost in the immense data that is provided to us and I feel that I'm having a hard to honing down to a particular question that I want to solve (for the project) that at the same time, is also answerable with data."
Having the freedom to do a project on something I am interested in,"The assignments, I just take a long time completing assignments, but that's just because I struggle with coding."
I've enjoyed the content of the classes the most so far! It's all interesting,"The discussion sections have gotten pretty long, but I like that we can check our answers after."
"I loved learning how ethics is not overlooked! I always wanted to learn more about ethics, and I am glad that this classes does not fail to mention them. It keeps me reminded on how I need to be a responsible engineer. ","I wish we could get more help through a system like autograder, but that might be a personal preference. "
Learning skills in data analysis which make good use of it,Too many backgrounds and concerns on data analysis
"I like the learning of pandas as I previously had a class that used it, but was not taught it. Therefore, I manipulated data without actually understanding what I was doing.",I have liked everything in this course about equally so far. I find all the topic covered interesting and useful. I am not bored with anything. 
The lectures have been very pleasant. I love the style of class and how professor Ellis has made the material easy to understand.,I personally do not like how much time I spend on the discussion assignments. I spend a lot of time trying to understand the question and then trying to solve it but its been very time consuming.
Learning new tools/methodologies for parsing and analyzing data,"The first few lectures were a bit slow for me, mainly because I already knew a lot of topics introduced at the start"
"Learning about the entire field of Data. This is my first data science class, so i find it all really interesting.",Probably all of the time I spend debugging my code haha
It's a lot more relaxed and not as demanding. ,I feel like lectures move a bit too fast. It's always one thing to the next without much explanation. Also discussion sessions I feel like a pretty useless
"Data visualizations! Being able to actually see the code I wrote (and you taught) be put into sight was super cool. But besides the concepts we've learned, I really enjoy how patient and fun of a lecturer you are. Big shoutout to the oh-so patient TA's as well","Well, I'm not a great/well-versed coder so naturally, I don't like the coding part, but it's still fun to learn I just wish I had more time to absorb the information"
The assignments and labs are really clear,I think it's pretty good
"I surprisingly enjoy figuring out how to properly code in Python during the assignments, perhaps because I hadn't coded for a while (since CSE 11 last winter). It's satisfying how quickly I can run my code in the jupyter notebook!","I think figuring out as a team what to approach for our project was difficult. We had directions we were interesting in heading towards, but had to really figure out which ones would yield a significant enough perspective, which had data sets that could give us ample information, etc. I am excited to get rolling though now that we have our research question!"
"My favorite portions of COGS108 were those that had direct real-world parallels, like when we were going over github and when we went over data bias.",My least favorite part of COGS108 is the submitting process on datahub. I'm constantly forgotting to submit my assignments and have to revisit the page after I finish (assuming I remember)
meeting my group members,"Least of all - I don't really like weekly quizzes, but i understand why we need them"
I really enjoyed learning new Python techniques and just more about data science in general.,"I dislike that we have multiple things due every week. E.g. quiz, hw, discussion."
"freedom of final project, ta/prof contact and accessibility",i like it
I am enjoyed learning about accessing libraries and dataframes to create visuals. ,Hardest part about this class is learning command line to push and pull repo. 
Learning how to wrangle data,Everything is very new and tough. Takes a lot of time to learn the concepts
meeting new people in the group projects because it helps it feel like the class environment (which I never thought I'd miss) + how applicable what we're learning about ,"I like that all the deadlines are on the same day, but I do feel like it's a lot of work each week when balancing 3 other demanding classes too. "
I have enjoyed learning more about using pandas to visualize data. The assignments so far have been great learning experience.,Nothing in particular. The pace is a bit fast but I am learning a lot.
"The assignments have been challenging, but in a good way. It feels good when. my code finally works",not knowing where the project is headed yet gives me some anxiety
Working with my group,completing the assignments and labs 
The seabron and the plotting from python.,The vague expectation for the final project's group works.
Learning more about data science,Discovering A2 was basically a precursor to a lot of what I couldn't quite wrap my head around in D3.
"This is the only class I have this quarter that is both well organized and engaging. My other classes make it extremely difficult to learn even by remote learning standards, so this class is the semblance normalcy for me. ","Sometimes it's hard to wake up for this class in the morning, so I can't always attend synchronously like I would prefer"
I really like working with data and programming in python overall so thats what I've liked the most so far (the opportunity to learn about the power of data and see it personally through programming assignments in python),The least I have liked about COGS108 is that its online and one doesn't necessarily get the help they need in person (which can be more clear). Overall I think this course has done great job in making up for that which is good. 
All the ways that python can be used to keep track of data,"Github, but that could just be that I might not still understand how to use it"
I enjoyed the most doing the assignments because they're informative and give a thorough understanding of how to use pandas and seaborn.,I do not like the discussions too much because it is a little too open-ended and can sometimes be really difficult to answer some of the questions. D3 was one where it was very hard because I had to wait until Friday's lecture to do some of the questions more easily.
"I actually like doing the partner project since it gives me an opportunity to meet with new people. I think the way the project is structured is done very well. Most classes have final projects and you only start doing work for it in maybe the last 2 weeks, but in this class we started very early and I like that. It's super well structured and gives us a good start without having to scramble at the last minute to finish anything.","Honestly, I don't find much of if non-enjoyable. "
The lectures and assignments have been really helpful in teaching the basics of pandas and hands on with manipulating datasets. ,"Using github to work on the project. Only because our group meets up over discord and works on it together, so github doesn't really facilitate all of us working on a document together. But I'm sure it'll be more useful as we make smaller changes to the document. "
I enjoy doing the group project because it offers me an opportunity to communicate with my classmates in remote learning.,The Lab Assignment is a little bit difficult sometimes.
simplicity of demands,im melting
What I enjoyed most about COGS 108 so far is the overall set-up of the assignments. I have learned from every single assignment that I did so far. They also are set up to build on each other and there doesn't seem to be a dramatic jump in difficulty between them.,What I liked least about COGS 108 is really nothing. I think this class is pretty well prepared during the online era of college. I enjoyed everything about this class so far.
The group work. My team and I picked a very interesting topic and talking about it and speculating what we might see is fun.,The weekly quizzes. I've been going to all the lectures and I still struggle with them.
"I really enjoy the pace of this class. The discussion labs help us think more about the material on our own without too much stress, as well as helping prepare us for the homework and project. This class gives us time to practice what we've learned in class before moving too quickly on to another topic. ",I find it hard to get other people in my group to work on a group project when our only form of communication is online. 
The content in general is really interesting. I find the way that we are able to acquire data from websites and other places so cool.,"Sometimes in the weekly discussions, the instructions are a little vague so I have to spend more time finding out exactly what I need to do or ask other people who to interpret the question."
Learning about the data wrangling techniques. I love data analysis and how it could be applied to literally any field to make hypothesis about relationships between variables and draw conclusions.,The discussions because I have trouble usually with knowing the right way to solve them.
The coding assignments on datahub,"Sometimes, the I feel like I don't have the appropriate knowledge to solve coding problems on the assignment and feel frustrated."
"I like the structure of the class. Concise, well laid out lectures. Assignments all due on Friday. ","I don't like working with my group. It's awkward, I try to talk to them but they're all hesitant to share their thoughts. So I unintentionally became the team lead in order to get things done. My teammates are still putting in the work though. Also I think that they don't attend lecture so they're unfamiliar with Github, etc. so more of editing the files fall onto me, which I'm okay with but it would be nice if the technical skills were more evenly dispersed in my group. "
Learning how to analyze and visualize data ,Idk 
I think that the lectures are pretty informative and helpful.,"I don't have many complaints, but the assignments are frustrating at times as with any coding. "
A lot of the material I have learned in other classes so far but I like familiarizing myself with GitHub. Wish we could do a little more with it though.,I feel like the group work has been a lot less exciting than I was hoping for. This would be my first project class so maybe I just don't really have a very accurate expectation. 
I've enjoyed doing the Discussion assignments because they're helping me practice my Python skills. ,"I don't feel that the Technical Discussion have been super helpful for the Discussion assignments. For D3, the TA/IA leading the section I went to just spent most of class walking through Babynames, so I didn't really get to ask any questions about D3."
"Working with python has been my favorite part. I have used java in my last several computer science courses and getting to use python feels like a breath of fresh air because it's so much more intuitive and it works better for me. Also, I quite like working and submitting in Jupyter.","Occasionally one of the assignments will have a vague question and it's hard to tell if I answered it as was intended, or sometimes I've already done something in a workbook that I'm asked for later and I don't know whether to remove it from where I did it on my own first and move it there, make a note about it, etc. The workload is pretty heavy on a weekly basis compared to most of my other classes, but that's both a pro and a con for me since I do enjoy the material."
I like the hands-on Jupyter notebooks and the flexible course schedule.,The documentation for various Python functions can be arcane.
"I enjoy completing the discussion labs and assignments, I think it is quite helpful.","The group project is not as interesting as I thought, it was hard to find a good research question"
"So far, I have really found it useful to get a refresher on the basics of data science and programming with data in general. Sometimes, in more complex classes, I just end up googling at every step, so its nice to go back and revise the basics, to solidify my understanding.","I don't like the quizzes system. I think it is probably because I am frustrated from missing one of the quizzes by accident and losing that part of the grade. I think the assignments are useful  and do a good job to make sure that students are on top of the material week by week, so I don't understand the purpose of the quiz."
"The application of our new skills and methods towards the goal of making a project, rather than memorizing for an exam","I Don't like how many of the lecture and learning materials are in different places, such as GitHub, Datahub, and Canvas"
Assignment 2!,The syntax. Plus Ive been spending too long on discussions
"Wide variety of information being taught - clear explanations for new information introduced, along with plenty of material (discussion) to explore aspects not covered in class. Lectures are a good mix of notebooks with hands-on learning and pdfs for other material.","Lack of guidance in project - it's not clear which TA will be supervising our project or if we are on the general path for producing a 'good' project. I recognize this stance may be hasty in judgement, as we will be getting reponses to our Final Project Proposals soon."
"learning python, being able to make quick graphs of a data set feels like an extremely valuable skill. ",What I have least liked about COGS 108 so far is mainly the group work. I do not mean to be mean but the work feels like its just a 1 week break and then do something for a half a day and then next week or next next week and i think that is fine but i forget a lot.
I liked learning and using Pandas in A2.,
Learning pandas and learning more about python. I enjoy the content being taught. I find the information to be helpful and a nice tool to use if I ever need to use it in the future.,"The discussion assignments are confusing to me. I find it difficult to do the discussion assignments even after watching lectures and reviewing the discussion section video. I find that it takes up too much time to complete, and I could be focusing on other assignments that are due the same day such as the quiz or assignment/group project."
Guided DataHub assignments; I think progressive application of material helps me to learn the best,"Coordinating group project stuff because of having to resolve various schedule conflicts, especially since I have a job outside of school"
I really enjoy the way we look at the notebooks in class and see how things actually work.,The lab/DI work we do each week doesn't do much to aid learning as there is little guidance. Assignments seem to be better at this.
Being able to learn about so many different things about data science. This course really opens a door for me. :),The discussion labs are sometimes challenging
I really like working with Jupyter Notebooks for lecture notes because it is interactive and allows me to explore the codes also after lectures.,There is nothing that I dislike :)
The ability to come up with a project idea on our own and pursue the research in a reasonable structure,"Really like the class, wish it was in person."
Learning python,
"I enjoyed how beginner-friendly and kind all my groupmates, the professor, and staff have been for this class. I would say this is the epitome of a positive, open-minded learning environment. I also enjoy how welcoming and easy-to-talk-to Professor Ellis is.","I think that if the lectures were a little more geared towards the Discussion and the Assignments for this class, it would be ideal. I find myself a little confused on the wording of the questions within the worksheets and problems of the homework due at times, especially also the failure of assertions to work on problems (e.g. the 1950 until now question in Discussion 4) confuses me at times."
I have enjoyed the research on different topics for the group project.,I least liked some of the difficult questions on the assignments that I couldn't fully grasp through past lecture information and having to rely on searching the web.
Covers everything required for data science,"It is alright at the moment, just feels like theres plenty to keep track of."
"I have learned how to wrangle data by using pandas and seaborn packages, and the Fernmi estimation. So far in my opinion, python is more flexible language to deal with data analysis than other languages like C++ or Java. ",None. I'm certain that every lecture is very useful and meaningful. 
I enjoyed discuss with my partners and we came out a lot of ideas.,I feel python is a little bit challenging.
"I enjoyed learning about the differences between the different graphing libraries. Though I used the different libraries, I didn't fully understand the differences. ",I dislike doing the quizzes. I wish the assignments and discussions would replace the quizzes.
"How the assignments guide you on what to do. For example, A2 had examples of how to use the operations it wanted us to us","I think the Term Project could use a bit of more guidence, I feel like it is rarely talked about in class"
the class structure,dicussion
Exploring what python can do,that groupby specific question in D3 cuz I couldn't figure it out
The lectures are engaging and interactive!,"Despite having background experience in Java, the discussion labs and assignments can still be a bit confusing. I think this is naturally me just trying to learn something new though."
"The Assignment PAs, they feel thoroughly written ","The Discussion assignments, feel much more tedious than need to be "
Learning how to utilize Python to conduct data analysis and learn more about given research topics seems highly useful and applicable in future projects.,The assignments (mostly A2) have felt fairly dense and difficult to complete (however this may be due to my lack of experience with programming/data analysis).
"I've enjoyed the programming aspects like interacting with pandas the most. Coming into this course, I was already comfortable with programming in general, but I never took the time to familiarize myself with these popular python packages. So, I think it's been a great first exposure to these tools.","This will probably have to be my group. After 4 weeks, I feel like 2 of the group members are dead weight. Either they don't contribute or they write like minimal effort/thought sentences, which will require us to redo the sections for them. As a result, despite having 5 people, it's more like 3 individuals doing all the work. Furthermore, at least for me, I think even if they don't do anything, it's definitely harder to focus when you know that you're somewhat carrying other student who simply don't seem to care."
"I've enjoyed the lectures, straightforward directions, and available help",
"I like the group work setting. I enjoy that I am allowed to choose my own teammate. In classes where I have no control over my teammate, I find it very difficult to hold my teammates accountable and thus my grade was affected. I also like the optional discussion/lab. I have learned a lot from the discussion while not having to worry about losing points during the process.",COGS108 is my favorite class this quarter. I really do not have much to complain at the moment. 
I've enjoyed everything for the most part. I feel like I'm learning a lot in regards to data science and the curriculum is interesting and engaging..,"What I've liked least is that the discussions feel really hard, while the homeworks feel pretty easy. I find myself lost often on the discussion."
"I enjoyed the amount of time we get to complete the assignments. A lot of us having a lot going on, so it's nice to not be on a time crunch for everything.","I mostly just dislike having to get up for class at 9am, but that's pretty much it. The coding is stressful, but it always is for is so it's nothing new."
The live lectures are really nice,Kind of wish there was more of a chance for interaction besides in our groups.
I enjoyed most about how we get to practice the skills that we need in Jupytr notebook. I feel like the assignments and discussion are helpful. ,The note in jupytr notebook are sometimes hard to read. 
I'm glad that i learned how to wrangle dataset and create colorful plots to find relationship between numbers and objects.,"I feel there're some functions of pandas and seaborn that i'm not familiar with, so i need to spend relatively longer time to learn in order to wrap them up and deal with discussion assignments. I also hope we could have more iclicker questions to practice."
"Although the most difficult, I have truly enjoyed the Assignments in the class so far. Although we've only done the assignments on the easier end, I've enjoyed tackling each problem, and have found myself surprised at how much I've learned! I really enjoy the open-ended type of questions that allow me to think about what strategies I can use - although the occasional hints are also extremely helpful! ","Occasionally, I feel as though the lectures utilize a few methods that could be a little more explained, especially for students (like me) who have minimal experience with Python - this particularly goes for Data Viz concepts. However, I understand this could be simply a lack of understanding on my part, but if we could somehow get a type of reference sheet with Data Viz functions and differences between packages, it'd be really helpful! "
Learning how to use the different python libraries.,I'm not sure if I dislike anything.
"For a class that has a coding prerequisite, I like how the professor is still taking the time to explain basic concepts instead of rushing right in. Without having a strong coding background, I am still able to follow along most of the times and the pacing allows for slow listeners and slow learners to not fall behind.","There are some aspects of the code being used that has not been explained or brought up in lecture, and I many times find myself googling very simple things but with different websites giving me different definitions. Would be helpful if there was some standardized reference sheet for syntax."
"Seeing how I can  use code to find the average  of my data or any other information I need from a data frame is something I have enjoyed. It is pretty neat that I do not have to go through all the data, but instead I can write a  a code that will fetch the data for me. ",The assignments. They can get very tedious and frustrating. It can become really difficult sometimes to understand why the code does not pass an assert or why it raises an error.
"I like that most of the material (python libraries, EDA, and ethics) isn't being made unnecessarily difficult. For me personally and where I'm gauging myself at, just having more exposure to and having the chance to practice these basics? is super helpful. It's encouraging to not be drowning in new material for once. Instead of stressing out learning new things, I get practice with important skills, something that I feel other courses don't offer.","I wish there were more optional readings/materials. More exposure would really help these topics ""settle"" for me!"
The thing I enjoyed most about COGS108 so far is learning about how to take csv files from websites and making them into datasets. The assignments are very fair,The discussion assignments are much more difficult and pretty vague. 
I enjoy programming in Python and trying to plot various data. I have a lot of experience in Python but I do not have that much experience in interpreting and cleaning data like this.,"The different types of plots have been something that I have not been enjoying. I have worked with different plots before in a stats class, but interpreting and nailing the difference between each of the different types is something I'm not entirely used to yet."
Working with my group members. Establishing new connections.,The weekly quizzes. I feel like they are not helpful.
I enjoy the format and the digestible information is great for people new to data science,"I think the topics are really interesting, but I would like more of an emphasis on how to perform a data science project with regards to a data sci project in industry. I think the project could be more rigorous as I would like to be able to use this project  as an opportunity to promote my data science skills"
Learning Python and web scraping.,So far I find the course very interesting and there isn't anything I particularly dislike.
Assignments,Discussions (they are very hard)
"I really like the group project and the structure involved in the deadlines and instructions. It feels very structured, and helps us really understand how to structure and communicate to be able to do a project with others and what deadlines are necessary","The weekly quizzes, cause there is always 1 question that I can never be sure what the answer is cause I'm a little confused on the phrasing of the question or which answer is being desired, so it just slightly bothers me"
I enjoy learning about the ability to make data models which I want to use later for Machine Learning,I do not like the constant stressing over one question
"Really learning about how to question data around the world and the fact that discussion labs, which are a bit more simple compared to assignments, can be used in substitute for final grade. ","Although this cannot be avoided, the fast pace of utilizing python is my only ""complaint"". Coming from a person who had never coded in python before, it was difficult learning the basics and applying learnings from class. Another inevitable fact is that I need to take this course this quarter, which happened to be a very challenging time for both education and my mental health. Other than that, I cannot think of any legitimate complaints!"
Lectures aren't so condensed that both conceptual and technical content (like specific functions) put together. They're also recorded and rarely go over time.,"I think technical contents aren't really covered in lectures, so it takes a lot more of our own research time to look up functions covered in the discussions. It would be a lot more helpful if lectures could cover at least some content for discussion as it could further reinforce our familiarity with functions that we would probably use in our final project."
"I think I've enjoyed importing and learning about different uses for python that apply toward data science and analysis in the real world. Prior to this, I had been wondering how exactly my Cogs degree would result in me being able to be qualified in analytical data, so now that we're doing it, it feels pretty satisfying.","I think what I've liked least about COGS 108 so far is our group project. With the pandemic and varying time zones it is very difficult for all of us to convene at a  specific time, and because of that some members feel pressured to put in work before meetings than they have to. This results at an inherent imbalance in work distribution, which doesn't necessarily occur out of any malicious intent, but rather self preservation. "
Working on the assignments - it's a nice way to get introduced to Python.,Working on the group project - I do not enjoy working in groups.
"I've largely enjoyed the teaching style. Professor Ellis is very clear with her explanations for the various different aspects of the course, especially when we go over python/pandas/etc.","The adjustment to using python has been a bit of a struggle, as I am largely used to using java. Yet, this isn't a great deterrent to the course as it is a learning opportunity."
nothing,"coding and doing the projects.  process of writing codes are too struggling for me, and the topic the project of my group is hard for me to fully understand. Honest talk, Sorry.."
Making beautiful viz!,Nothing really
HOMEWORK,
Working on the group project during this pandemic makes me feel like i am not alone and also going to the OH and chat with the tutors.,All the office hour is kinda early in my time zone.
learning about python because I didn't know much going in,"My project group, which seems to have abandoned me"
Doing the Discussion question,The process for figuring out the problems
I've enjoyed the Assignments the most. I feel like I'm learning as I walk through them.,"I don't learn a lot from the discussion sections, and it always feels like there's not enough time to cover everything. "
The clear lectures! They're easy to follow and introduces the topics well.,The discussion sections have been a bit vague for me and I often struggle with getting through it. 
Learning how to incorporate data science into our lives,The amount of coding :/
