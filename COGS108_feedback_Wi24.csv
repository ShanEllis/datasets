enjoyed_most,enjoyed_least,,,,,
"The pace is moderate, easy to follow but not boring.","We have to work in a group. personally speaking, I dont like group projects",,,,,
I enjoy exploring data science more using Python.,"I don't really like when labs, lecture, and assignments are released and students can't run the code without errors popping up. For many who are not familiar with Python, it is hard to figure out these error messages. A lot of the lab code especially always has errors.",,,,,
"guest lectures, being able to hear real life experiences is helpful",weekly lecture quizzes,,,,,
"Assignment, there is a step by step guide how to finish the assignment. By just doing the assignments, I gain decent knowledge","Assignment, because its also time consuming.",,,,,
Coding,Group members not responding,,,,,
I enjoyed the guest lecture. Hearing about other's path to data science and associated reflections is very helpful.,"The assignments are very hard for me. I am new to git, github, & jupytr notebooks so all the jargon, syntax, folders, etc.. is overwhelming and intimidating.",,,,,
learning more about data visualization,Some weeks having both discussion and an assignment due,,,,,
I enjoy challenging myself on exploring Pandas and reinforcing my coding skills,I sometimes have difficulty with the D & A Assignements,,,,,
I like the relaxed nature of the class overall and how the assignments are meant to be too stressful but rather for learning,The weekly quizzes are rather time consuming and don't really reflect the course material learnt that well sometimes,,,,,
I enjoyed the guest lecture the most because it brought insight into the industry.,I do not like the weekly quizzes because they are timed.,,,,,
Working towards the project,The quizzes are a bit too unrelated imo,,,,,
I really like doing projects and doing data analysis.,I don’t like being assigned to a group because I cannot work on group projects with my friends.,,,,,
I've had a great revision go Python,Too much introduction to python,,,,,
"I like learning about the different coding avenues (pandas, seaborn, etc). I like graphing the data the most.","I haven’t really not liked anything, although it was hard to do the previous project review and understand someone else’s code at times (maybe because we haven’t learned all the different techniques yet)",,,,,
I like listening in lecture.,"I don't really like Python, because I feel like the only thing I'm doing for the homework is finding the right function.",,,,,
I have enjoyed the discussions the best as they are a good summary/practice of what was covered throughout the week,COGS 108 has been fun! The only thing I don't like is how early the class is :( (and I have a conflict with the 2pm section so I cant go to that one),,,,,
"Learning about data science, and how to solve an interesting data science problem.","Need to walk at least 15 minute from my apartment to the classroom, especially during the raining day, I know it isn't actually related to the class, but other than that, everything is fine.",,,,,
It's my first python class so I've enjoyed learning and actually coding in python,I tam not really enjoying pandas. I know the class is all in pandas but there's a lot of syntax behind it and I'm having a hard time understanding the parameters and the order to do things.,,,,,
"Learning about data science, initially I thought it would really challenging since I am not that knowledgable with coding but I actually have a lot of fun doing the assignments and learning about topics within data science.","Since this is the first time I'm learning about data science, I wouldn't know I don't like this but I struggling with learning how to use pandas and wrangling since there are a lot of different functions and codes, and it gets pretty confusing.",,,,,
Learning Python and using pandas to manipulate large data sets,"The lack of direction with the projects. This might be my own doing, however, I am slightly confused about this whole process.",,,,,
"So far, I have enjoyed the labs in COGS 108. I am new to Python, and the Discussion Lab Assignments really help me to learn the different functions and syntax. The structure of the labs and the guidance they provide are really effective at teaching how to code in Python.","So far, I have least liked the Assignments, because of the hidden tests. I feel I am doing the assignment right and understanding the code, but then when I receive my grade, it does not match up with what I thought. I understand the hidden tests raise the stakes of the assignments and are there for a reason, but I feel as though I learn best from the discussion labs, which do not have any hidden tests and you have a clear understanding of whether or not you are coding properly.",,,,,
I've enjoyed the labs as they are straight forward and also have really good guidance before each question. Thank you for all the extra credit options as well.,"I've disliked the frequency of assignments (I also feel like the actual Assignments are quite lengthy in nature), and this can be tough to manage with midterm schedules of other classes. I wish we had more ""late/slip"" days.",,,,,
Learning more about python. I knew the basics of the language but I mainly code using Java. The course is really helping me strengthen my skills in this language.,The group I have for the project. Not all members communicate effectively and contribute the same amount so its a bit concerning.,,,,,
I like when the professor discusses ethics in data science.,My team hasn’t been the easiest to work with so far. I also wish there were more office hours.,,,,,
I think the assignments have been pretty fun and a good balance between time spent and concepts tested. I've found myself thinking pretty thoroughly about them without feeling like I'm doing busywork.,"It would've been nice to pick our own groups, since this might make project planning easier and give us a chance to find a group with similar interests and skills. But, I have no complaints about my group.",,,,,
I enjoy learning about how data impacts people and that we are working to a practical project,The programming assignment and discussion assignments have coding portion that we do not go over in class. It would be nice to have more review and time to spend on learning the syntax of pandas and seaborn.,,,,,
Expanding my knowledge of Data Analysis practices and the novel mindset that Data Scientists use. As an aspiring Epidemiologist I find such strategies and skills valuable and fascinating.,"The emphasis in lecture seems somewhat disproportionate: while the class does acknowledge a certain level of familiarity in Python it still seems strange we quickly rush over code for various table manipulating tools but spend half a class on the differences between histograms, bar plots and other graphs.",,,,,
"The data visualization part. I really liked how we can use python to draw diagrams and visually present data. I also liked the tasks that we had to do in A2 and D3, where we were using diagrams of data to answer specific questions.","As a beginner to programming and coding, I thought that sometimes it’s quite confusing what each syntax means and sometimes I don’t understand why I have errors when running codes.",,,,,
Learning about Data Science and using Python to analyze data because I think these are very useful skills to have and will be important for my future career.,The thing I liked least about this course so far is that we have to submit work on datahub since I don't think the UI is very intuitive and can be confusing at times.,,,,,
I don't really enjoy coding.,What I've least liked about COGS 108 is the entire course.,,,,,
I enjoyed just getting to know how to use pandas and seaborn. It's pretty neat and I like finally getting to know exactly what data science means.,"My least favorite thing was when I was doing D3, I wasn't aware I should have done A2 first and I struggled a lot more than I should have.",,,,,
"More practice using pandas functions! In my upper div DSC courses, we don't really do this anymore and I missed what I somewhat missed what I did in DSC 10 and DSC 80.","Data visualization week was very repetitive of DSC 106, but it definitely is necessary to understand how to make visualizations and what makes them ""good"" or ""bad"".",,,,,
I've enjoyed doing the assignments because they're good practice for skills I think I'll need.,I've liked the 9am class time the least because I don't like getting up early.,,,,,
I enjoyed the assignments because they helped review my knowledge of python/,Sometimes I do not like the lack of instruction on the labs because I'm not sure if I am doing it right (but I feel like that's the point).,,,,,
"weekly discussion, really good remind what we learned from the class","everything good, but when i use data hub, sometimes it's really slow.",,,,,
"i like that we're working on a real project, because if we do a good job, we can use it for our portfolio.",i think the pace for the project is a little fast,,,,,
"wrangling data with pandas, there is just so many things I can do and I learned a lot.","plots, since they are not fixed (meaning you can have multiple answers) and I'm not familiar with it.",,,,,
Labs,Assignments,,,,,
How organized the class set up is and having abundant of materials making finding for materials very easily. Professor Ellis is also very caring and understanding which making the overall experience more enjoyable.,The Assignment or Lab instruction can be a little bit open ended which make doing the assignment a little bit confusing of what the expectation would be.,,,,,
The thing I have enjoyed most about this course so far are the clicker questions. This is because I have to take a step back and actually think and process the information I learned during class.,What I like least so far about Cogs 108 are the labs. I think the labs have been much more difficult compare to the assignments.,,,,,
Getting know more about data analysis.,Nothing.,,,,,
"I like that there is the option to attend class in person or remotely through podcast, as it makes it easier for a commuter like me if I can't attend class in person for some reason. I also like that grading mistakes are fixed very quickly, as it reduces anxiety about my grades.",I'm aware that this isn't like an intro data science class but I did not expect to jump right into learning about it and only briefly going over python basics (I took COGS 18 last year so it wasn't exactly fresh in my mind).,,,,,
learning how to code! and generating plots,i don't know what kind of question to ask for final project and everything cramped in midterm season,,,,,
"I enjoy lectures in Cogs 108. I think the professor is a good lecturer. It sort of feels like review for me, as a Data Science major, but I feel that it is still useful. The GitHub lecture/information is really great and fun to learn about. I also like talking to my peers in lecture. It is really nice to either complain together or simply learn about other. I actually made friends with those who come to class often, and it makes me happy.","The assigned group projects and lab/assignment directions. I have hesitations around group projects and even more-so when I do not know the other group. Mine has been a bit difficult, but the Professor has been helping me as the quarter continues, so I think it will get better. The lab directions and the assignment directions are often unclear. I feel like a lot of the time I am guessing as to what the directions want from me. I feel like the wording could be a bit more clear. If I have to look at multiple sections of the problem to figure out what they might want, then I think there is room for improvement.",,,,,
"I've enjoyed how engaging the course is, having variety of assignments like discussion, being a more open type of class",So far something that I least liked is the communication within the group.,,,,,
assignments are easy and fun to do,the quizzes should have another attempt,,,,,
I enjoyed using jupyter hub in order to code graphs and basic functions.,I disliked the complicated commands that is used on making bar graphs/sea plots,,,,,
I enjoyed working on the assignments in this class. The project so far is also going well.,I have no complaints for this class.,,,,,
Many might consider COGS108 as simple but it is perfect for people like me as a beginner who knows nothing yet.,the assignment and discussion is more time consuming than I expected. I expected 2 hours for A2 but actually I spent 5 hours since i was very new to everything. For D3 I spent about 4 hours to double check the answer and make sure I understand the prompt correctly. Some of the D3 instruction is not clear enough.,,,,,
"Learning about various aspects of data science is the part that I enjoyed the most in Cogs 108. It gives added directionality to what I can do with Python moving forward. Although I don't aspire to be a data scientist, the concepts I learn from this course such as data wrangling data, creating plots and being mindful of ethics/data privacy can go a long way in any career. I also enjoy attending lectures since there is never a dull moment.",Mostly the lack of passion and communication for Cogs 108 Project which is expected given the randomized assignment of members. It is very difficult to light a fire under people who see this class as a check in the box. I also feel separated from potentially meeting others who are genuinely excited in doing something interesting. This gives me further insight of why talent management and team cohesion are so important.,,,,,
I enjoy the assignments,I think the quizzes are a pain,,,,,
I am enjoying using python because the only other experience I had was in Java,Difficulty in planning with groups,,,,,
The Professor explains the topics so clearly and concisely especially for people who are not familiar with data science or coding in general. The clicker questions are so helpful in reinforcing my understanding of the topics that are being covered and they help me stay engaged so that I know how to answer the question. It also helps me to interact with the people around me and ask for help or their understanding if I don't know how to go about answering a question.,"The project isn't explained very well at the beginning of the quarter. I feel like we have a rough idea of what to do but for people that are not familiar with the subject I think it would be nice in the future to have like half a class for instance discussing what the project will look like, a good example and the feedback the professor gives, and time for the students to ask the professor questions about the topic.",,,,,
We get to try a lot of data science tools in practice through assignments and discussions.,"The due date being Sunday has been very stressful for me personally. I’m part of a competitive dance team on campus, and have had competitions on weekends, making the Sunday night due date for everything difficult to make. It has definitely impacted my performance on the assignments, as I missed small things that were caught by hidden tests later. In the future, I think Monday night, would be a better option. That way we have the weekend to work and, in the worst case scenario, get last minute help on Monday before submitting.",,,,,
class isnt very stressful,discussions are harder than assignments,,,,,
learn pandas in python,the assignment instructions sometimes seem to be confusing,,,,,
I enjoy the freedom we have with deciding on our topic.,"Learning to code is difficult right now. I took COGS 18 and have other programming experiences using python. However, I have very little experience with stats and found it difficult to understand the documentation for Seaborn. More clarification on how the syntax works would be helpful.",,,,,
I have enjoyed practicing pandas and I look forward working with my group.,N/A,,,,,
The assignments are interesting,It’s a bit confusing seeing which assignments I have done and submitted. In general keeping track of assignments,,,,,
"So far, it has been an interesting yet challenging class as I am not the best at python or coding in general. The lectures have been engaging especially with the iClicker questions.","Sometimes it may not be completely helpful when I am trying to look back while trying to complete the discussion labs and assignments. That is usually ok because then I would try to search it up on Google, but it can be somewhat frustrating to do so.",,,,,
Learning how to use imports like pandas and numpy,"Not being able to choose teams, but its not that big a deal",,,,,
"I enjoy how the lectures tie in application to the real world! I feel that a lot of courses I take never make the extended relationship to how we or others might use course concepts in the field. I also really appreciated the walkthrough format of A2 because as someone who has never coded with Python before, it was nice to have a more formal and guided introduction to common functions and strategies.","I did not like how D3 was much more difficult compared to A2, as I would have expected the main assignment (A2) to be harder than the lab assignment (D3). However, I usually complete D# before A#, and I wish that the D#'s could be formatted in a more guided walkthrough.",,,,,
Gaining a better understanding for pandas and data visualization because I believe it is an important asset.,"I would like the labs for the discussion assignments to give more specific instructions on what functions we should be using to complete the question. Sometimes, it asks us to do something that we have never done before without giving us the library function that we need to use to answer the question.",,,,,
"I've enjoyed the labs and assignments, I think they are fun and I have learned some new things from them.","I've least enjoyed the quizzes, they also feel tedious, but they don't take long so it's not a huge issue.",,,,,
"It's been a relaxing, not too stressful class. The content is new and fun to learn about since I haven't taken a data science class previously.","Accessibility to get help. Probably towards getting help on assignments or discussion work. All I know of are my lab hours, but usually I take up the entire time completing the discussion assignment. Also it was a bit difficult to coordinate good timings with my team, which is out of control of the course and staff of course, but that was a small issue.",,,,,
"Learning about plotting graphs, because seeing the graphs gives me a clearer sense of what I'm learning and a sense of achievement.","Struggled with the assignment. Because I have a really poor coding background, I needed to look up a lot of things online. However, this is my problem and I understand the course design, so this has nothing to do with the course.",,,,,
I like Dr.Ellis' explanations during lecture. She's a very good lecturer! Also the labs reflect what's taught in lectures.,"I guess the random group assignment. Although I know that it is often the case in real life that people from different background need to work together, it takes a lot more time to communicate between each other since we have different expectations and experience.",,,,,
"The assignments and labs. I feel like I learn a lot from them and they're equally challenging and fun, as well as interesting with the types of data we get to see. Definitely my favorite assignments I have ever had from any class.","Uncertainty about project, feeling stuck.",,,,,
To learn about the ethics behind data science. Because usually people just use the data without consider how they collected and processed the data. Understand the ethical fields of data science really impacted me a lot.,Everything is good so far.,,,,,
"I have enjoyed doing the assignments, because it has allowed me to apply the skills talked about in lecture. In addition, it really helps to remember and understand how to apply skills discussed.","Although there is nothing severe, there are certain parts of instructions that are often unclear.",,,,,
The labs are interactive and helps learn about the course.,Sometimes feel like there are too many assignments to keep track of.,,,,,
I've liked learning about different ways of displaying data and which visuals are most effective in displaying certain kinds of data,"I appreciate that we've gone over the basic concepts however I feel like so far what we've learned in class isn't aligning to the bigger scope of what we have to complete for our project. For example, our project proposal is due however I dont know how to go about deciding on a research question.",,,,,
"Love the discussion and assignment, pretty helpful for organizing the project",Don’t have too much communication with my group,,,,,
I like that the class accommodates those who can't make it to class in person. I also like the lecture format and the discussions are very helpful.,Datahub sometimes freezes or has trouble running.,,,,,
The lab homework,Nothing so far,,,,,
I have enjoyed my discussion sections where I get to collaborate with my classmates.,"I have disliked when my code doesn't run and I am stumped. But, it ends up ok!",,,,,
"Hands on experience in doing data science related tasks such as data cleaning, data visualization, EDA, etc and having a group projects to work on.",Weekly discussion is not that helpful for me since it just went over the discussion assignments.,,,,,
I actually really like doing the asingnments. They are fun and engaging. I also think that the material itself is very interesting and fun.,"Some of the questions on the datahub assignments are a bit confusing and unclear. Especially for the ones that require visualizations. If some of the questions could be a little more clear, it would be highly appreciated.",,,,,
I have enjoyed the lectures the most. The professor explains topics very clearly. I also liked the guest speaker session.,I found the last lab difficult and didn't enjoy doing it because it took a long time trying to figure out what worked and what package methods to use.,,,,,
I really enjoyed the lectures and figuring out the homeworks. The homework allows me to use the lectures and apply it there.,I feel like I like everything so far. Maybe the tests and hidden tests are hard to understand.,,,,,
The content in lecture is digestible and the pace works really well for me. I often don't need to look back on the slides after lecture because I understood the content during class.,Some of the discussion lab content can be much harder than the examples given in class. I would like to see more examples in general.,,,,,
I really enjoy how we make plots to visualize datas,So far I think the pase of the class overall is too slow.,,,,,
"The discussions, because the TAs in the Wednesday at 12 class gave helpful hints and tips.","The one Sunday that had a discussion, assignment, project review, and week quiz. It felt a little overwhelming.",,,,,
I enjoy leaning how to use pandas.,I like drawing plot the least.,,,,,
I have enjoyed learning how to use python to visual data. I have never used a coding language for data science and am happy I am starting to do so.,I have disliked not knowing the solutions to assignments and discussions after they have been graded. I believe I have gotten the right output for every assignment but I don't think my code was the optimal way to produce such result. I am new to pandas and seaborn and would like to know what the most efficient way to get the desired output.,,,,,
I've enjoyed learning different applications of data science and I appreciate the variety of fields covered in examples.,Sometimes the assignments/discussion assignments take a long time and there are kind of limited office hours.,,,,,
Using python and being exposed to more skills I can put on my LinkedIn,my friends stopped showing up to lecture :(.,,,,,
"I enjoy writing code and generating plots with python. Although it might be tricky sometimes, I always feel accomplished when I finished it.",One thing I liked the least about is the vague grading system. Sometimes I don't understand what the lab questions are asking for and what kinds of answers are accepted.,,,,,
I've enjoyed the coding aspect of this course. I feel like I'm actually learning how to engage with data science in a practical and marketable way.,"I feel that I have to do a lot of outside research to figure out how to do the assignments. I understand that any tech job requires a constant drive to learn and problem-solve, but it can be a bit frustrating when you're learning something fundamental for the first time.",,,,,
i've enjoyed the assignments,i feel like the class goes by really slowly but i think that's more on me,,,,,
The course content is interesting,NO detail about homework,,,,,
"I like the lectures, I really enjoyed it.",coming to session in R,,,,,
I like the weekly quiz because it summarizes some key points throughout the week. It enables me to review the slides afterwards if I felt confused on the question on the quiz.,"After reviewing past final projects, I felt a little bit stressed about the length and difficulty of the project (but overall felt excited).",,,,,
"learning how to use datahub, I code a lot as part of my major but I always enjoying learning new languages or programs.","communicating with my group has been a bit difficult, but I think it will be better from now on.",,,,,
"The theory behind data science, and interesting studies/example for how we come to understand data science.",Nothing so far!,,,,,
I like being able to learn python again and also using jupyter notebooks to learn pandas as well,I least liked the fact that the iclicker app required a subscription after the trial,,,,,
I enjoyed working on the assignments as it's my first class about data science and it's fun looking at datas.,none,,,,,
"I've enjoyed attending lectures the most because of Professor Ellis's teaching style. I believe she explains concepts very clearly, and at a perfect pace, and her lectures are very well organized. I also like the fact that we have many extra credit opportunities, especially since a big percentage of our grade is based on a group project (which can be somewhat unpredictable)","I generally don't have any complaints about the class; my experience has been very positive overall. However, there are a couple of minor inconveniences I've encountered. Accessing the PDFs on DataHub still doesn't work for me (I get a blank screen) and also, the process for submitting assignments feels a bit uncertain. The lack of confirmation emails or a clear indication of which file has been submitted can sometimes be worrying. I understand that these issues may be beyond the professor's direct control and more related to the platform's limitations, but if there are any improvements that could be implemented, it would certainly help with this issue. Generally, I do enjoy how everything is centralized and accessible from Datahub and how we don't need many different platforms to manage files and submit our assignments.",,,,,
"I was worried if lacking experience in python would make this class challenging, but the lectures and assignments guided me in a comfortable pace to build the skill up, making this class more enjoyable than other courses.","I hope the labs could also help us on more than just lab, as assignments and projects are more challenging than labs.",,,,,
The most part that I enjoyed is to learn a few practical skills that can help me to do some real-life analysis to the data.,"As for now, I enjoyed everything in COGS 108.",,,,,
"I feel that with the pace and lecture, I am learning theoretically as well as practically. With the project and the lectures, it's very well balanced and the material is very interesting. I feel that this class is a great way to learn data science practically different from other class that focuses too much on lecture","Nothing, everything is great",,,,,
Learning about ethics and how a lot of data can be bent one way to show something even if it's wrong or not objectively correct,Using datahub,,,,,
"I've enjoyed the assignments as they provide a good amount of context and resources to help guide me through the assignment. Although they are a bit lengthier than the labs, it is very satisfying when I complete the entire assignment and pass all the tests.","If I had to choose something that I like the least about COGS 108, I think it's been a bit difficult engaging with my project group. One of our group members has not interacted in our group chat or meetings at all, and I'm worried that this will impact our overall grade on the project.",,,,,
Labs because I like doing python coding that is easy to walkthrough,group projects stress me out,,,,,
The labs,Assignments can feel overwhelming during this time of the quarter,,,,,
I have enjoyed doing the labs. They are great components of the class that have opportunities to learn.,"I think the quizzes just because we have to wait till friday to do them since I like to finish the other assignments due Sunday earlier if I can. However, it does make sense since we need to have the week lectures done before it and at least they are not too long.",,,,,
Learning about how to do visualizations.,assigned teammates,,,,,
I have enjoyed learning more about python and how to digest data. I think that it is fun to have the creative freedom to decide what's the best way to make data interpretable.,My least favorite thing so far has been trying to figure out a topic with my group for our project proposal. I think that we had a variety of different interests so it was more of a challenge to find something that everyone was passionate and knowledgeable about.,,,,,
"I've really enjoyed the assignments. I love hands-on experience of content I learn, so it's been nice practicing my python, numpy, pandas, and viz skills in the assignments.","D3. I was overthinking about how to do the different visualizations, so that took quite a while. I was getting frustrated but then was eventually able to figure out a simpler way to make them.",,,,,
I enjoy learning about data frames in Panda that allow you to organize data effectively.,"I have a hard time with coding, so figuring out data wrangling has been tough",,,,,
Learning basics of how to wrangle data - I think it's a super important skill to have and I enjoy coding,"D3 - I had a really hard time with some of the problems, especially the one involving displaying a table based on the male/ female cheating proportions. It felt like there was supposed to be an easy way to do it but I ended up having to do it manually from the value counts. The value counts object type also confuses me, it seems to be kind of accesible in a similar way to a df but some things that are supposed to work on DFs dont work on them. I'm also super confused by the groupby and aggregate functions",,,,,
"I enjoyed the organization of the notes and the lecture, of how easily accessible and legible it was.","I was not too fond of the iClicker EC, as it requires students to purchase either the physical device or the subscription of iClicker to participate. I understand that it is an extra credit therefore participation is optional, but I believe the option to participate should be open to all without financial burden. iClickers can easily be replaced with other methods such as Google Form or non-subscription based participation tracker. In addition, some exercises on assignments and Discussion Labs require knowledge beyond what we are taught in class, especially in knowing specific methods to organize dataset. Sometimes it requires a learning beyond simple Lab sections or internet search where I had to spend multiple hours on one part of the question. I wish the difficulties of these questions be modulated, so that it is challenging enough but also solvable within an hour or two.",,,,,
Learning about how graphs could be made using seaborn and pandas,I wish there was more time given for explaining the code and how it can be used to implement different features for the graph.,,,,,
"Doing the pandas assignments and learning a new tool has been fun. It has been frustrating to deal with errors but overall it's nice to have a new skill that I can develop and learn more about. I like the structure of the course, it feels like a crash course to data science and really sparks my interest in the field.","The group project aspect of it. I am the kind of person that doesn't like group projects in general, which this class hopefully will help me overcome. It has also been difficult coordinating with the group so far, which makes me nervous for the future of this project. I understand that this is a necessary part of professional development but it is the least pleasant part of this course for me.",,,,,
"I have enjoyed learning more about how to effectively analyze and describe data. Specifically, I have actually really enjoyed creating different types plots for various datasets, and watching these charts be generated from lines of code, even if typing out all of the code for generating these charts can become a bit tedious at times.","So far, there has not been anything I have disliked about COGS 108 so far. Even though coding is not my main interest or the focus of my major, I have greatly enjoyed learning and practicing coding in general, and I have yet to find something about the course or the topics being taught that I dislike.",,,,,
"I enjoy the pace of the lectures and how you make every effort to make the class relevant to us. I also enjoy the participation questions you pose mid-lecture, but...","I don't enjoy the usage of iClicker for the extra credit participation. Yes, I understand it is completely optional, but I just think iClickers (device or the app) put up an economic barrier to entry in the sense that you'll have to pay anywhere from $15 to $45 to access that option. I know many others have had iClickers before this class, but this is my first class at UCSD that has used them, so I myself had to pay. I DO enjoy the participatory aspect of them -- the in-class little quiz questions are excellent ways to test my understanding -- but I feel a different method can be explored. (For example, COGS 101A last quarter tracked participation with Google Forms while still employing the mid-lecture question method.)",,,,,
"I have enjoyed that we aren't being penalized for not going to lecture in person. So many classes force you to go by doing attendance or things like that, but since we aren't forced, it's nice to just watch the lectures online.",I can't really think of anything.,,,,,
The structure of the course is very easy to follow,I'm not the biggest fan of random groups as we all have very different ideas for things.,,,,,
"Learning about data science is interesting to me. As a math major student, I know little about data science applications, and this class is showing me what I don't know.","I don't like making graphs. Especially, I think making a good graph is challenging.",,,,,
the industry talk was very interesting,"some library functions are very specific, documentation is sparse",,,,,
"I've enjoyed learning more about the various seaborn plots and getting used to using them frequently, as it's helped me in my other CS classes as well.","I think having numerous assignments all due on the same day can be overwhelming sometimes, though I do like having the confidence that nothing will be due until that day each week.",,,,,
I enjoyed learning how to create different types of plot using code,"Coding D: just because I'm not a ""pro"" at it yet so sometimes it gets a bit frustrating when I'm trying to solve something but I keep getting an error",,,,,
"The homework assignments, I always like brushing up on my python and staying in the mindset of thinking like a data scientist when manipulating datasets.","Maybe some of the code on the discussion questions was confusing, but otherwise I have nothing to say.",,,,,
Learning git and github; it seems like it's the most useful skill for being a data / computer scientist besides actually learning to write programs.,"Maybe this is just how upper division classes are (I'm a first year so I have only taken one besides this) but I didn't see much of a 'tutorial' for things like git, seaborn or matplotlib. Just meant I had to look up the documentation and learn for myself which isn't necessarily bad, just a little more time-consuming.",,,,,
Being able to do a project where we can explore data and make interpretations from setting up data.,Working with people who simply want to get work done and get things over with.,,,,,
"I have enjoyed the labs the most so far! I've only taken COGS 18 and don't really have too much experience with python, so I feel like I've been learning a lot more applicable methods and things that I can bring outside of this class. Sometimes I do take excruciatingly long and stressful hours on these assignments, but it gets completed. :)","Sometimes I get frustrated with the assignments, I usually get really stressed out from Thursday - Sunday night if my assignments are not completed, but I realize that learning is not always smooth and that I am simply on a different learning path than everyone around me!",,,,,
"Not having to go to lecture, its convenient.",Having to do a project with people I don't care about is really annoying. It would be better if they were more competent/proactive.,,,,,
I really like the discussions,I don't like how the assignments are not super specific. I wish the instructions were better,,,,,
I have enjoyed getting to know some people in my class through working on the group project. Normally when I take a class outside of my major I do not interact with anyone since I normally don't know anyone else taking that class.,I have liked reading the pandas documentation the least. This is because I tend to learn better with examples in front of me rather than trying to figure them out by reading the documentation.,,,,,
"I've really enjoyed mastering the concepts, such as how to make plots using seaborn, and then getting to implement it in the jupyter notebook. Getting to create plots very quickly and with a good understanding of the topic is so satisfying.","What I've liked least about the course is the final project. I think that being able to see the entire rubric for a very large project became very overwhelming, and being able to only see one step at a time would help me to slow down and pinpoint exactly what is expected of me.",,,,,
"I like the clicker questions and easy way to participate and stay engaged in such a large class, which is generally harder to do.","Since there is usually info from all 3 lectures during the week that is needed for labs and assignments, it is a bit difficult to work on those HWs ahead of time, since I often have to wait until Friday to understand certain things or I can't always attend lab early enough in the week to be able to do the labs. As in, it ends up often that they can only fully be done on the weekend. I know one solution (and maybe an aim of the class) is to break it up and do just a portion at a time to incorporate what was learned each day in lecture, but that is not always feasible since it's easier to do it all over a shorter time span of a couple days, but still harder to complete ahead of time (especially when trying to not do things last minute!)",,,,,
"I enjoy that we have both assignments and discussion labs, because the discussion labs help to get additional practice and understanding without the pressure of needing to know everything or do everything myself. Then, the assignments can serve as a mini-quiz or knowledge check.",I disliked that I don't know where to look for resources on the python libraries that we use. There are SO MANY on google and it's hard to find what actually answers a question I have or applies to what we are specifically doing in a lab or assignment. If the course staff could compile a list of sites (maybe there's already a reading list that I missed?) and announce it (or remind if there already is an existing one for this course) it'd be deeply appreciated.,,,,,
"I've enjoyed getting hands on coding experience! I'm taking another class on R right now, so this goes together with that really nicely to reinforce everything I'm learning.","Sometimes I feel like the jump from what we do in lecture to what we have to figure out in the Demo assignments is a little fast. I feel like I pay attention during lectures and follow along in the notes, but I often spend quite a while on the assignments trying to figure it out.",,,,,
I like the discuss section. TA explain more detail on coding.,The group project. I know it's good for us，but everyone is so busy that it's hard to schedule time for discussion,,,,,
The pace of the class. I don't feel rushed at all when learning new topics.,The wording for labs and assignments. Especially with D3 it was confusing what exactly some of the questions wanted me to do.,,,,,
I liked solving coding problems and see different functions that panda has. Making the data clean gives me a sense of accomplishment,I don’t really like making the graphs haha,,,,,
I have enjoyed being able to learn more about python!,I dislike the discussion labs because they are tedious and difficult.,,,,,
"I've enjoyed the labs so far. Very low pressure, pass the tests and I'll be fine","I'm struggling to come up with answer to this because I can't think of anything to complain about for this class, so this question. Have had some issues with datahub going down around 8pm one time when I tried submitting a lab, but I suppose its the servers getting stressed from every other student trying to submit their hw the night its due",,,,,
My most favorite part about COGS 108 is its organization. I believe having all of the coding assignments and lecture notes in one place (JupyterHub) is very helpful.,My least favorite part about COGS 108 is the coding work because it is difficult.,,,,,
I liked learning how Github works in detail and what push/ pull meant etc. I feel like I've used Github in the past but completely unaware what exactly I was doing.,"I've not liked how slow it is so far, but that's because I have a lot of experience with pandas and data science.",,,,,
Reviewing past projects because I love the idea of combining data science with real world problems to address real world situations,I think i find the pacing a little slow up till now but am noticing an increase in pace from this week onwards.,,,,,
Learning and exploring pandas because I enjoy learning new things and using them in ways that I never knew.,The large amount of busy work because I am getting overwhelmed by other classes.,,,,,
I enjoyed working on the project with my group because we get to think of our own topics and they are all very supportive about any ideas people have!,I liked the assignments least because its sometimes challenging for me to do and I’ll have to spend some time on it.,,,,,
"I enjoy the coding portion, even though I find it difficult and struggle often because I haven’t learned Python before, I find it to be a good challenge. I also like the guest speaker lectures since we got to see data science through the lens of someone who works in the field.","As someone who has a lot of group project assignments this quarter, in general, I would’ve not preferred to have an another one on top of them. Nonetheless, it’s interesting to apply the course concepts in a setting like this one.",,,,,
Learning data science and pandas in particular,Not much to complain about. I wish there was more explanation for the graphs and how to customize the graphs,,,,,
"I have enjoyed just learning about the basics of coding for data science and going through the labs and assignments. I also especially like learning about ethics in data science, since it is very relevant to current issues.",I think D3 was kind of hard and confusing based on what was taught in class. I felt like I still had to look things up a lot on my own outside of the notes. I also would prefer to learn everything needed for the assignments and labs by monday so that we can start on both earlier just in case it takes longer.,,,,,
"I have enjoyed the pace of the course, and both the professor and the TA sessions have been helpful . Also,the lecture is engaging and not difficult to comprehend.",N/A,,,,,
"Learning about pandas, which is very practical in the data science world, has been my favorite part. Sitting down and learning the methods and plots will allow me to create my own data science projects. I also love the light workload.",There is nothing that I dislike. I think it is a very structured course.,,,,,
"I really enjoy the timeline of this class, having all the assignments due on Sunday and having the leeway to work on the assignment throughout the week. I really do enjoy learning from this class, there's a challenge but also an incentive to learn more.","Least favorite part is the inability to take this class on zoom. I wish that was an option because it makes it a lot easier to access, especially during the times of extreme weather.",,,,,
What I enjoyed the most about COGS 108 so far has been the assignments and discussions because I like knowing more about how to use pandas and the operations as I did not have a lot of experience with it before.,What I liked the least about COGS 108 is that collaborating with our teams for the project is a bit tough as some people disappear for a long time and did not really help much for the previous assignment.,,,,,
"I enjoy the consistent and clear communication between the instructors/TAs with the students utilizing Piazza. I appreciate how the responses are quick. Adding on, I enjoy the lecture materials.",N/A,,,,,
"The professor, makes the lec so interesting and makes me want to attend in person",nothing,,,,,
Contents are chill,None,,,,,
"I enjoy formatting the data that we get and making it more easy to understand. I think this is interesting because I think that data is very important, but if we do not understand that data well then it is not as valuable.","One thing that I like least is the inability to choose groups. I think CSE110 was fair with how groups were chosen, they allowed us to choose a partner and then paired 3 random pairs together to form a group.",,,,,
"I enjoyed the assignments the most, I think I learn the most from them and it's easy to follow them step by step.",The group project is really hard to organize and have everyone participate. My group always has at least one or two people missing from our meetings so it's hard to anticipate how much we can get done before the due date.,,,,,
I've enjoyed learning how to code,Not sure,,,,,
"I guess the data handling as I learned more about how to handle, clean, and manipulate data to get what I want from it.",Nothing really.,,,,,
"I enjoyed about learning new data analyzing techniques. I had worked with SQL launched by java only before, so everything we are learning now is pretty new to me.","I don't really like how our labs are not really helpful for finishing the discussion labs. I am not going to the session that I signed up for, but I don't find the session I'm going to helpful. I hope we can have more constructive help in the labs for finishing the discussion labs.",,,,,
learning about different ways to create visualizations and freedom on the final project,not a lot of practice coding during the lecture making the assignments feel a little harder,,,,,
I love learning about pandas because it is such a fun library.,There are many EC opportunities which is awesome.,,,,,
Enjoy the study process.,none.,,,,,
Learning more about coding.,"Code not working, errors, not knowing what is causing those errors.",,,,,
"The labs are perfect, such a great way to learn without beign stressed about the grades","Nothing specific, I think the class is greatly designed.",,,,,
I have enjoyed doing the assignments the most so far! They're very instruction-based and have helped me become more comfortable with python libraries and methods. And also the whole data analysis aspect of it that is involved.,"The labs have been a little lengthy and frustrating... from my experience with COGS 18, I expected the labs to be more straightforward in order to help with the assignments, but it seems to be the opposite in this course.",,,,,
"Solving the homework problems, really gives me insight into what data analysis looks like.",Nothing so far.,,,,,
The lectures and assignments are engaging and easy to access. I also like how flexible the course is in terms of scheduling.,"I can't participate in lectures without an iClicker, and that costs money to purchase. I don't have other classes that need an iClicker, so I'm opting out of that form of extra credit.",,,,,
I enjoy the group project aspect of the class as it allows us to actually apply what have been learning to do some ACTUAL data science,"I don't really like how are the assignments are on data hub, not gradescope etc, but at the same time it is good to get familiar with this environment as I am using it in other classes as well",,,,,
Being able to do the assignments essentially however you want,Very little instruction most of the lectures do a poor job of explaining packages being used,,,,,
The part I have enjoyed the most about this class so far has been getting to look at the projects of groups from prior quarters and seeing the work they did with their own topics they chose to research.,"My least favorite part so far has been the initial phase of getting in contact with the group, though that doesn't have to do with the class or group specifically, so much as just how the process generally goes, and the difficulty of scheduling time where everyone is available.",,,,,
I enjoyed the assignments quite a bit as they seem pretty easy and interesting to do. Specifically working with data frames has been fun.,"I think some discussion assignments like the recent one were too confusing in the wording that it was hard to figure out. In particular, creating graphs is very confusing and I feel like I need to learn more about it.",,,,,
Labs,None,,,,,
I enjoyed in review all the basic pandas/numpy. And I love to learn the data visualization tool.,Sometimes I was facing weird issues when submit my lab.,,,,,
The weekly assignments to keep me up to date with the material.,Lack with integration of LLM's as I feel like this is vital to the current practice of data science. (I could be wrong),,,,,
I found the detail in the assignments very helpful and engaging!,I would like if participation was worth more,,,,,
I like how most of the data science concepts are covered in COGS 108,I think the Python basics took too much time because I think most of people enrolled in this course should have programming experience.,,,,,
The most enjoyful part was making my first pull request. It was a new experience and I enjoyed it a lot,The least enjoyable part was recounting on the python basics,,,,,
"I have enjoyed the visualization of data and getting more familiarized with the pandas and numpy packages. As someone interested in machine learning, which involves lots of data preprocessing, and am working in a machine learning class, it has helped a great deal.","I have not disliked anything about the course so far, just hoping my group project gets through smooth sailing in starting the quarter-long assignment!",,,,,
I think the concept is beneficial for me towards my future career. There are a lot of application that I can use in the future.,I think there are too much work for me to do every week. There are different assignment and quiz for students. It is hard to memorize when to submit which assignment.,,,,,
"I like most about COGS 108's assignments and deadlines, very straightforward.","I think randomized grouping is not very efficient, though I understand that is what it like in working environment. But we can only have fraction of time meeting each week so the whole project is going really slow.",,,,,
I enjoy working on the discussion assignments and the lectures are pretty engaging as well with the Jupyter notebooks.,I think the instructions for the assignments can sometimes be a little vague so it takes longer to understand exactly what the question is asking for.,,,,,
The guidance in the work we have to do has made it less stressful for me. It makes me want to start earlier and work on it because I feel like I can possibly figure it out even though I'm not a strong coder.,"The final project is intimidating, especially with random group members that are sometimes unresponsive or do not seem like they really want to try.",,,,,
I enjoyed learning about Python because it's a new and more commonly used coding language that I did not previously know.,"honestly, the data visualizations because I'm still learning Python so it's been more time-consuming than I predicted but it's not so bad. The group project is also a bit confusing but we're just getting started so perhaps I'll understand more with time.",,,,,
Great pace that I can keep up with. I can follow the lectures along and am learning at the same time.,Having some connection errors with datahub. Not sure how it can be fixed though.,,,,,
I enjoyed the first 2 discussion assignment that wasn't as hard,"Navigating to the material. I usually use computer for jupyter notebook and iPad for pdf lecture. If you can upload the pdf of lecture on canvas, that is much more accessible for me!",,,,,
We learned a lot about how to process data.,N/A,,,,,
"So far in Cogs 108, I have enjoyed learning about how to use different graphs and coding these graphs during our lab and A2 since I feel as this is a necessary tool that we will need to know for our future roles in our professional careers.",I have disliked the group project in this class so far as I believe it may take a long time to accomplish the whole project but am still ready to work with my group and complete it as we have a great start already.,,,,,
"The parts of COGS 108 I have enjoyed the most are:
1. The (optional) engagement/participation in lectures with iclickers, since it feels like more people show up to the class and attempt to learn
2. The option to go to discussion for guidance on labs
3. The detailed instructions within labs and assignments","The thing that I have liked least about COGS 108 is that I had to pay for an iclicker app subscription because I didn't have and want to use the physical kind. I understand that it's not really the instructors' fault, but of course I don't like using up money.

Other than that, everything is fairly smooth sailing.",,,,,
"Working on the project is an enjoyable experience because we have the freedom to select any topic that interests us. This hands-on approach allows us to apply the theoretical knowledge gained from textbooks to real-world tasks, giving us a sense of truly utilizing what we've learned in practical scenarios.","At times, the material covered in COGS108 and COGS189 seems to overlap, particularly during the initial three weeks. However, as the courses progress, it becomes apparent that COGS108 focuses more on data programming.",,,,,
I like the pace of the lectures because it is not so fast.,I don’t think I learned a lot of technical things.,,,,,
I like applying what we learned to assignments and actually working with data in a workbook and seeing it come together,"Nothing in particular, maybe that lectures aren’t spent working on harder material that the assignments showcase, concepts in lect are quite simple but actually applying them is hard",,,,,
"Learning through the labs and assignments. I am more of a hands-on person, so being able to work through it on my own to learn, rather than listen to lectures makes me enjoy the class a lot more.","Sometimes the instructions on the assignment and labs are unclear. Sometimes I worry that I have points knocked off even though all my assert tests pass. I also have never used github before. There was a lecture on it to work through it, but that doesn't guide me through it very well. I have also done the github tutorial, but it still doesn't make sense to me.",,,,,
I enjoy the lectures. It's not boring.,"I hate GitHub. I have no clue how to use it. We have to submit our proposal on GItHub and I'm scared I'm going to mess up. My members also don't know how to so like, it is up to me apparently, which is no shade to them, just like :(.",,,,,
I mostly enjoy using python in order to wrangle data.,The prompts in the discussions and assignments are open ended in regards to the approach we can use which is fine but sometimes what is looked for in the end result is not entirely clear.,,,,,
I like how clear and intuitive the course is structured.,I kind of do not like how the quiz and lab are given out on Friday and due Sunday. I personally would prefer finishing all my assignments during the week days and have some personal time on the weekends...,,,,,
I have enjoyed working on the labs. They provide excellent hands-on practice for the concepts we are covering.,"The fact that we didn't get to choose our own groups, but I understand that choice. Still, it would have been way more fun to work with people I am close with and we could probably finish one of the greatest projects of all time.",,,,,
ATTENDING CLASS. I like the interaction that happens in class,group project.,,,,,
the groupwork,PA's,,,,,
I enjoyed most the systematic learning of using pandas and other python tools to analyze data.,N/A,,,,,
The course provides plenty of opportunity for us to practice.,"While it is a relief that we don't have any exams for this class, I am a bit lost about how to study for this course.",,,,,
I like the pace of the class and how it is structured where we learn about concepts and then get to see them in action in the notebook.,"I wish we could get more insight into the code, some f the discussion labs were more open ended and I had to search up a lot of the stuff.",,,,,
The progress I have been able to make in working with data. Early on in the course I felt very unfamiliar with navigating data but this course has made it very procedural and more easy to know how to approach large datasets.,n/a,,,,,
I have enjoyed doing the lab assignments the most because the questions/tasks are always related to finding something out about the data so it feels like a game and worthwhile; even for someone that has been overwhelmed by coding assignments in the past.,"By the same token, I have least liked the coding aspect but not for the application of it, more like the concept of coding itself. However, it's just a learning curve and a personal challenge it's not that serious of a dislike. I do appreciate that I was fairly warned at the start of the quarter!",,,,,
The guest lectures were insightful in what data science does,it's been pretty good so far,,,,,
I am enjoying learning about the various ways we can represent data visually.,"I think the pace of this class is ok, but it is kind of daunting seeing previous projects and how time consuming they may be. I am worried about time management regarding this class' big project and my other classes.",,,,,
the guest lecture - it was neat to see how data science applies in the industry and to see how someone similar in our position is now in the working world,the labs - these are a lot more work than I anticipated and they sometimes cover material that we did not go over in class,,,,,
I have enjoyed getting to learn about data science and what it entails.,I have liked the least how the labs/assignments descriptions and questions are confusing which makes them hard to understand what it is asking for.,,,,,
"I really enjoy learning more about data science, and I actually enjoy doing the assignments on datahub, specifically something like A2. Those are a bit more guided but it is really helpful in helping me understand specific functions and how to use them.","I'm a bit unsure how we should be pacing our projects and how often we should be meeting. I suppose I'm used to a team project being the main focus of the class, and not so much as a side thing that students have to do entirely themselves. I think having a requirement to go to at least one discussion time would help my mindset about this class, but I realize that it gives students a lot of flexibility with the structure right now.",,,,,
Learning python through datahub,The fact that we cannot choose our groups for the final project. I feel like the groups would mesh better and be able to communicate better if we could choose them ourselves or at least choose some of the group members,,,,,
The assignments,The group project has been a bit rough.,,,,,
"I like how the labs really help with the assignments. If I try to do the assignment before the lab, I definetly struggle more. I also like how it is easy to get help just by looking at each library's documentation.","I think it has been a little hard to follow the slides, but it is still manageable.",,,,,
I like learning how to use pandas and seaborn to plot,"Sometimes, labs can be more challenging than assignments and able to see the test cases would be really helpful.",,,,,
Flexible structure so that we can attend lectures at different times or re-watch,"Labs can be a little confusing since there is less guidance; also think it has been a little hard connecting lecture content to the labs at times.
It also would have been nice to pick our group members for the project, but I understand you are studying how self-picked versus assigned groups work.",,,,,
It's sometimes frustrating but at the same time fun to organize dataframe to be tidier. I also especially enjoy exploring relationships between data and making graphs with datasets. Sometimes they can show me very interesting and unexpected correlations.,"Probably the wrangling data part. The syntax are complex and hard to remember. Errors occur here and there, and they appear so easily with each additional line of codes... I always have a headache trying to deal with unorganized data.",,,,,
I enjoyed how the hw and project are so tightly connected to the lecture.,I would like this class to be a little bit faster and include more topic.,,,,,
"The guest lecture, I thought it was very informative to see how what we learn in class can be applied in the industry.",I don't have anything particular in mind but maybe the constant deadlines/due dates is hard to track,,,,,
"Guest lecture, as it provided nice insights into data science careers","Felt unprepared for lab 3 despite going to lecture,",,,,,
I've never used the pandas dataframe so figuring that out through assignments/discussions is fun.,Communicating with my group because its hard to get 5 people on the same page.,,,,,
"So far, I have enjoyed the discussion labs the most. They have been very helpful in teaching me how to do data science practically.","I have liked the group project the least so far, as it has been challenging to communicate and find time to work together.",,,,,
I have really enjoyed the discussion assignments. They are quicker than assignments but I feel they cover really important concepts for data science.,"I don't really enjoy the group project. I feel as though if we were able to pick groups, it would be much better on coordinating schedules, but because of the randomization it becomes really hard to meet consistently.",,,,,
Coding. I enjoy writing code more than visualizing data or explaining findings.,Haven't really touched on anything yet since most of the course has been coding up to now. But now we are moving into our projects so I know there is going to be a lot less coding going on and more thinking involved with creating a project. There is going to need to be analysis and explaining of findings which is not particularly fun.,,,,,
I like the hands on work in the assignments that really give us the opportunity to implement everything we learn.,"Sometimes the class feels slow, because of my previous experience in Data Science, but I still enjoy it.",,,,,
I have enjoyed the content in COGS 108. I think the professor explains the concepts very clearly in lecture and that discussions/assignments are a good application to really learn the concepts.,I am not sure. I think I would like more TAs/IAs to hold remote office hours or sections because it feels easy to drop in that way while working on assignments.,,,,,
"I have enjoyed learning about the real world applications to coding, as it's not apart of my major so there's a lot I don't understand about its application in data science.",I am pretty bad at coding and it's really unfamiliar to me so sometimes it's really hard for me to see where I'm making a mistake in the homework.,,,,,
"I most enjoyed the lectures, as I feel like they help a lot with the homework as well as it is really engaging with the iclicker questions",I least like the assignments since I think that there is a lot work for the class,,,,,
"I have really enjoyed the material so far, all of the assignments have been very interesting. So much so that I would like to take more data science courses/look for more options after graduating related to this field.",Maybe some more resources on debugging could be helpful.,,,,,
I enjoy exploring more about different packages in Python that I have not had the opportunity to learn about yet. Being able to expand what I can do using a variety of packages and learning different ways to best perform an action has been exciting for me to experience.,"Communicating with my group has been difficult at times, but I understand communication is always difficult in group projects and I need to learn how to best communicate with group mates regardless of if we agree or not.",,,,,
Being able to learn more about handling datasets.,I wish to have more application of the things I have learned.,,,,,
I have really enjoyed learning more about Github and practical skills like making pull requests that are very helpful for working on coding projects and future jobs.,The group work assignments are a little long.,,,,,
Assignments in Jupyter notebook are easy to follow and fun to work on,Some of the discussion problems don't really specify which dataset is being used,,,,,
I enjoy the lectures because they are engaging and Prof. Ellis explains the content really clearly. I also like the amount of guidance the assignments have.,"Some of the weekly labs have been kind of difficult. I like the quizzes, but there are so many things to do by Sunday it gets hard to keep track of them all.",,,,,
How we look at direct examples of what we are talking about in lecture.,It's been more difficult to do the assignments and quizzes because the material doesn't fully tell us how to set up some things.,,,,,
Meeting the people in my group and working on the project.,Personally the assignments and discussions have been boring for me since I have learned all of that information in prior classes I have taken,,,,,
"I enjoyed the flexibility in this course. I can work at my own pace and plan out my own schedule. Since I live off campus, I can choose to just watch the lecture recording on my own time. Also, I have plenty of time to work on the assignments at whatever pace I chose since I can start one day and finish another as the assignments give me two weeks to finish them.","I don't really like the stress behind assignments with the hidden test cases. Even though the hidden test cases are just more of a generic check rather than edge case checks, I get stressed over misreading or overlooking a part of the instruction and missing points on the assignments. I think it would be nice if students were guaranteed a certain grade on assignments given they pass all of the visible testcases.",,,,,
"learning python in the first place! theres a lotta assignments but they are very doable, even for beginner programmer, and make it very clear what you are learning and its applications","the group project, but not bcuz my group or the project itself, just because the only time we are all available tends to be inconvenient for me",,,,,
Project groups because it's more collaborative than individual homework assignments.,The weekly quizzes because they are annoying.,,,,,
"I've learned how to use Python to clean data, draw charts, plots, etc. in a research which were things I did not know/ learn before.","I don't have anything dislike about COGS 108. There is only one disadvantage that our group comes from 2 sections. Therefore, it is harder for us to figure a common time to work on together weekly.",,,,,
"I liked the guest lecture from the data scientist at Cruise the most. It was very insightful to hear about the real life applications of the tools we are learning. It was also thought provoking, and had me rethinking my perception of the mechanics behind designing complex programs like automated driving.","So far, I feel that some Jupyter notebook assignments have been overly confusing. I found that me and many of my peers had trouble specifically with D3, which I think could have been fixed with cleared instructions.",,,,,
"I like the class structure, it is pretty clean and well organized. Easy to turn in homework without hidden tests.",Assigned groups. I want to work with people that I choose.,,,,,
"A lot of it is review/relearning familiar concepts to me, but I enjoy Prof. Ellis' way of teaching it. It makes me feel like I'm seeing things from a slightly different POV, and not just tiredly relearning things, especially the most recent topics covered.","The beginning part that was just Python coding review was pretty boring, since I have more of a Python background, but I understand some students don't have too much experience with Python/Github/etc.",,,,,
I've really enjoyed using the Pandas library alongside Seaborn. Cleaning and wrangling raw data and then getting to generate visualizations is a rewarding process.,"There is nothing I have disliked yet, but now that we are getting to working with statistics concepts, I foresee myself enjoying this topic a little less since I don't enjoy math much. Despite this, I see its importance and am still eager to learn it.",,,,,
The lectures: They're engaging. I also liked the guest lecture. It is useful in understanding how the application of what we do in class could look like in a career.,"I feel as though the labs (D2,D3....) are quite difficult and dont always cover what we did in lecture. Requires quite a bit of outside research.",,,,,
I have enjoyed the hands on coding assignments. I like how much freedom there is in finding and researching our own methods for data related questions.,I feel like the pacing of this course is difficult but this problem is mostly to do with the quarter system. I think it is rough that I am trying to plan a project that could or could not deploy a model when I don't yet know how to make a model.,,,,,
"Python coding, it's very relaxing.","Weekly quizzes, I feel like some of the tick multiple choice questions are a bit ambiguous / hard to answer.",,,,,
Learning to use GitHub properly,Lectures don’t feel directly related to our current work on the final project,,,,,
assignments due on the same day so it's easier to keep track of deadlines,"some of the assignment questions are worded confusingly, so it's hard to figure out what the question is asking for",,,,,
I've enjoyed coding in python because I've been coding in mostly java and python over the past year.,It's been challenging to coordinate with my group because everyone's schedules are so busy and don't always match up.,,,,,
Learning about data and doing hands-on learning thr,"The group project is starting to feel very stressful - especially since it feels like the amount and depth of deliverables expected this week (Project Proposal) is so much more than the first week after groups were made. I'm excited for what we'll make, but I wish we had more time to work on the proposal, or were sorted into groups earlier in the quarter so we could submit the proposal before midterms (maybe week 3 or week 4 instead of week 5).",,,,,
learning about the importance of being able to interpret data and the most suitable ways to visualize such data! i love looking at random graphs and data visualizations (r/dataisbeautiful is a very entertaining subreddit to look at) so it's been really fun learning about it more in depth,coding but that's because i'm a cog sci design major who hasn't taken a coding class in a few years,,,,,
"I've enjoyed honing my coding skills the most, even if it is a little tedious and frustrating",I haven't enjoyed being stuck on questions and realizing there was one small thing I needed to change.,,,,,
"I have enjoyed how well-organized the class is, especially how clear the instructions are on the assignments.","As a data science major, most of the content in the class so far has been review, making the course easier that I expected. I also would have liked if we could choose our proejct groups.",,,,,
data analysis,group project,,,,,
I like the iClicker questions and being able to discuss questions with classmates.,"Sometimes in class, the Jupyter notebook will run into an error or say a method is out of date on my end and if I can't fix it it prevents other crucial codeblocks from running.",,,,,
I like the breadth of what we cover. I enjoy learning about all aspects of data analysis and the variety of libraries that we use.,"Nothing really, so far my group is mostly been good. A couple people have been absent to meetings but they have been doing their work asynchronously.",,,,,
"do the DI, really help me learn a lot from it",none,,,,,
"The lectures, Professor Ellis is very clear, consistent, and professional in each lecture. It's a joyful experience I might add.",Everything seems reasonable so far,,,,,
The lecture is very interesting,"The instruction for labs and assignments were sometimes not very clear, which made me spend more time on the labs ans assignments",,,,,
Refreshing my skills in data analysis with python libraries,"Some of the discussions and assignments have vague instructions, and can sometimes be tedious to do",,,,,
"What I have enjoyed most about COGS 108 would be learning about pandas and Numpy. This is because I am a Math-CS major so I already had experience with coding in Python; however, I was completely new to using pandas and numpy for data so it has been enjoyable working with new libraries","What I liked least about COGS 108 was the first couple of review lectures on python because I already knew python so it was very boring and unnecessary; however, I understand why it is taught as many students need a refresher on python and coding",,,,,
"- good organization of content -> very good review and encapsulation of the topics
- also all things being due on the same day is very helpful -> more memorable
- there are also some interesting rules being brought up, like the one about 10s and estimation -> just cool pocket knowledge that's useful",not being able to choose my group,,,,,
I have enjoyed learning about data visualization because it was really cool seeing how different graphs can be generated and customized. I found it very helpful and interesting.,I have least liked learning about GIthub because it was confusing to me. I didn't fully understand how to do the assignment for it in D1. I wish we could have gone more in depth with this in lecture.,,,,,
"I enjoyed the most about web scraping and using different kind of plot such as sns because I happened to be using web scraping in research and other class, but COGS 108 lecture slide and code really helps a lot to understand conceptual parts. Also, other classes that I'm taking so far didn't discover seaborn plot, but it seems very useful tool to draw the data.",I do not have it.,,,,,
Coding exercises because it is enjoyable to me,"Some weeks have more homework than others, I don't mind the workload but I would prefer it to be more consistent",,,,,
Learning more about pandas and python.,A lot of things to remember and consider for my grade throughout the week,,,,,
Coding in python and completing the assignments,"Learning how to use these new libraries and methods, but still somewhat enjoyable.",,,,,
"I have enjoyed the professor! How positive energy she has about data science, the talks she shows us, and the way she teaches.",I have least enjoyed coding (as a non-computer science major).,,,,,
The plentiful resources available to succeed effectively in this course in all types of assignments and learnings.,"I like that the deadlines are all due midnight of Sunday for each week, although this can sometimes be tricky as working in a group for the project, things tend to be left for the weekend, which can be tricky to navigate last minute.",,,,,
I think I’ve really liked the assignments on Datahub. I think they really demonstrate the material well.,There hasn’t been much that I’ve really disliked so far.,,,,,
"The most enjoyable aspect of COGS 108 could be its focus on the ethical dimension of data science. It emphasizes the need for data privacy, informed consent, and the responsible use of data, advocating for continuous ethical scrutiny throughout the data science process to prevent harm and inequality.",Some part of the assignment is a little bit hard for me. But I will work it out.,,,,,
The assingmenta,clicker questions,,,,,
"I've really enjoyed our hands-on work with python - learning through practice has helped me retain the content pretty well, and I feel like I'm actually building applicable real-world know how. I really appreciate the emphasis on ethics in this class as well; it's eye opening and thought-provoking to recognize that data is not objective, and it's a good reminder to have as we learn to work with it.","Sometimes I feel like the content in the labs doesn't reflect what we learn in class; in lab D3 I ran into a task I didn't know how to implement. I read documentation, but documentation can be gnarly to sort through at times.",,,,,
I really enjoy the live demonstrations and the applications to cleaning datasets and creating visualizations. I've only self learned pandas for a lab project before so I only knew the basics and available usage of pandas but not how to prepare and clean data.,I don't have anything particular in mind.,,,,,
"I like how there is no midterms and instead we have weekly quizzes, because it stops people from having to cram everything for a midterm and I feel like generally we learn the topics better.",I have no complaints I feel like the amount of work we are given is fair.,,,,,
"I enjoy both the guest lectures and the project-oriented format of this course. I like to put my knowledge into practice and applying what I've learned to real-world scenarios, and the project-based structure facilitates this experiential learning. Also guest lectures help give me insight on the road path people take and what it is like to work in industry.",What I like least about COGS 108 are the assignments. I fairly new to pandas and seaborn so I spend a lot of time looking up the syntax and functions to understand what I am doing.,,,,,
I really like the labs and assignments because they are very hands-on coding where I've learned the most,"I strongly dislike working with my team, as they are pretty unresponsive and disengaged. I think it would be great to have teams assigned within sections so that it is easy to meet in person, since I think that type of interaction is much more conducive to a positive group dynamic than the occasional discord voice chat",,,,,
The assignments are fun and let me practice my pandas/visualization skills.,Assigned groups for the project. We should be able to choose who we work with,,,,,
"The programming, because I like being able to visualize data in an efficient way",Some of my groupmates are not pulling their weight,,,,,
"I have enjoyed the Data Labs! I think they are nice because they really allow me understand how to visualize the data. In addition, the open test cases are nice because I get immediate feedback on what I am doing and its accuracy.",I feel like the length of the quizzes have increased and the time it takes me to complete them has gotten longer. I wish the time allocated to do the quizzes could be extended by like a minute! But overall everything has been pretty smoothly with the class.,,,,,
I have enjoyed the lectures. I think that the lectures have been very informative and helpful for learning the material being taught. The clicker questions make them interactive and force me to integrate the information into my brain.,"I would say that I like the assignments the least because they do not tell me if my answers are right. They just tell me if my answers are in the correct format, but not if what I have done is correct. This means that I am not sure if what I have done is the correct thing or if I truly understand the content.",,,,,
Learning about pandas since it was my first time interacting with it,GitHub because I found it confusing,,,,,
I really enjoyed doing the labs where I get to experiment with what we just learned and it's low stakes.,Nothing major that I don't like about this course. I would say having all the assignments due on the same day kind of stresses me out sometimes.,,,,,
I have learned being able to learn something new each time and being able to interact well with lectures. It's also nice being able to get my brain going with with something different I'm not used to.,"Personally I'm not the best at coding and the fact that we're just thrown in with pandas, seaborn, and other packages, I'm not used to it, and it has been a year since I've taken a coding class so I feel lost and extremely stuck most of the time. Content will be mentioned during lecture and I understand it but it doesn't stick... then when it comes to applying it with assignments (labs specifically), I feel extremely stuck. And sometimes hopeless (if I'm being honest). 

Moreover, when it comes to labs, I have a hard time understanding certain prompts and what it asks of me (but that could just be a personal problem, who knows)",,,,,
"I have liked the group project aspect so far. While I am usually not a fan of group projects, my group works well together, and we are able to complete things well and in a timely manner. It is nice to have a good collaborative experience since unfortunately this is not always the case.","The labs and assignments often reference or require things not covered in lecture. While I understand prior knowledge of programming is expected, it would be nice to see some more methods/topics mentioned. There were a few times I would wonder if I was ""supposed to"" or ""allowed to"" use a certain method since it was not covered.",,,,,
I have enjoyed graphing the given datasets in the assignments.,I don't really like how all the assignments are due on the same day.,,,,,
Doing the discussion assignments is really fun! I love NumPy!,"Nothing really, its a great course!",,,,,
"Dataframe operations. Personally, I love learning about organizing data.","Interpretation of data. It's just that analyzing the data sometimes has some pretty strange results, so maybe I need to learn more about statistics.",,,,,
python and pandas review,"multiple different assignments, would be easy to miss an assignment if i'm not careful",,,,,
I like the discussions and how it feels to work through them. I feel like I'm gaining familiarity with the content. I've worked with pandas before and I like the discussions for getting me back into the groove.,"Not really anything, I think it's been good.",,,,,
"As someone who has exposure to research, I find the higher level concept very interesting (ex. domain expertise, data collection & cleaning, ethic).","I don't necessary dislike anything but I find the length of assignments are a bit long which might not be necessary to promote learning. Although it is completely understandable for the assignments to be broken down into step by step, having too many of them took away the motivation for me to explore and test on my own. By the end of the assignment, I just wanted to move on. To be fair, I always try to finish them in 1 sitting which might not be what the assignment intended to be. Having multiple smaller assignment might helps (ex. pre-lecture, post-lecture)?",,,,,
Learning about libraries in Python that help understand data.,"Some members in team project do not participate or communicate, leaving me and other members to complete the work.",,,,,
"I like the structure of the class, what is being learned/tested is always clear and digestible.",Nothing really.,,,,,
I have enjoyed the real world application of the labs and assignments so far.,"My project group seemed sort of uninterested when we met last time, so the final project might be more difficult than expected.",,,,,
The lectures are interesting and I like how there are many examples provided within the lectures.,"So far, everything is fine to me!",,,,,
"The lectures are captivating and learning about how to use pandas, seaborn, and overall data science techniques/libraries is very useful to know, even though I don't plan to go into data science.",D3 was fairly difficult and I feel like would have been nearly impossible if I was not able to make it to a lab that week.,,,,,
"Data Sci, because we can find a lot thorugh the data.",NA,,,,,
I am really enjoying discussing with the group for the group project since all of our group seems to be motivated.,Don't have any least favorite thing about the class. Every activities or PA seems to be reasonable and good practice for the final project.,,,,,
Being able to search around and find a unique/interesting research question,"Nothing, everything has been really interesting and more importantly practical",,,,,
learning python,would have been nice to have lectures online during rain,,,,,
Not having a midterm,Attendance in class?,,,,,
Learning about how to wrangle data and get meaning out of it has been interesting. It is a very helpful skill to use,"Sometimes it can be hard to understand how to get the intended output in labs and assignments, but it is expected and I can always go to lab hours if needed.",,,,,
I've really enjoyed doing the discussion assignments. I've been learning a lot through them and looking over the notebooks from class lectures has given me a good starting point.,There's nothing that immediately comes to mind and I appreciate how flexible the professor is with the attendance policy. I was wondering if the discussion section slides or tips are shared anywhere if we can't make it to one of them.,,,,,
I enjoyed learning different types of plot to show the data effectively. Also I liked that I could practice using those plots in lab and assignments.,I am not sure why things covered in guest lecture appears on the weekly quiz. I thought guest lectures are extra credit.,,,,,
I like how the class teaches the intuition behind data science in parallel with the techniques.,I dislike how the project based portion of the class occurs outside of class time. It feels like it's harder to work at the same time as a group.,,,,,
One thing that I enjoyed is how we use existed data to make graphs and then analyze them,"data set up process, I think it's boring",,,,,
Coding. I feel it would be helpful for my career.,Everything is nice so far.,,,,,
Getting exposure to different Python libraries for data science,"There are a lot of smaller assignments to keep track of (e.g., quiz, lab, assignment, group project), so it could be nice to combine some into one submission",,,,,
Recap a lot of Python skills while struggling with Java.,Not really.,,,,,
"The guest speaker, as I am a data science major most of the content has not been new for me so far, but I have enjoyed listening to the guest speaker and his experience in the industry.","The assigned groups for the project, I understand that the experience working with people we do not know can be useful but I was hoping to work with people I am anticipating on working with for my DSC capstone sequence to see how I like working with them. Also the differing skill levels in terms of coding does make me a little nervous as to how the project is going to go.",,,,,
I have enjoyed doing the assignments because it's hard for me to grasp the material until I do it myself.,It's kind of difficult to have everything due at once but it does make it easier to remember the deadline.,,,,,
I've enjoyed visualizing data.,I dislike that instructions are not specific.,,,,,
Learning about pandas and seaborn seems pretty useful.,I just generally dislike group projects.,,,,,
I think the content is interesting and the lectures have been helpful when I've been able to attend.,"Nothing too extreme, but some of the assignments seem to run a little long and the instructions aren't always very clear for them. Not a major concern but would probably be my least.",,,,,
"The guest talk was very insightful, as it showed me how the skills I learned in COGS 108 can be translated into the industry.",It would be nice if the instructions in the assignments could be more detailed.,,,,,
I love the interactive Jupyter Notebooks and graphics. I like how the code outputs results and explains them in a readable format.,I do not like having to pay for an iclicker.,,,,,
The quizzes,The pace is a bit slow,,,,,
Project should be fun hopefully,So many assignments paired with stricter late policies and grading for correctness and over strict grading scheme. Lots to juggle,,,,,
I have enjoyed constructing plots to make observations about the nature of a set of data the most. Making conclusions from the input data has been very interesting.,"My least favorite part of the class so far has been the some of the pandas/numpy documentation that i have head to read through online . A lot of this documentation does not have examples so it is a bit hard to completely understand what each method does at first glance. This no fault of the class, but it has been my least favorite part of doing the class.",,,,,
I liked learning version control for real world industry experience.,I don't like the quizzes due on sundays.,,,,,
I have enjoyed the assignments and labs because they are very interactive and allow me to learn,I have least liked the lectures because sometimes I find it hard to always pay attention and that they are a little slow and not focused on programming,,,,,
Interactive assignments,None,,,,,
"The interactive nature of the lectures, and getting to apply concepts through the discussion and assignments.","It can be hard to get comfortable and in a working relationship with the group, especially in the time frame and manner approached in this class. It would have been nice to have known the groups earlier, or had some more organized or structured way of forcing groups to meet.",,,,,
I have enjoyed the coding assignments and learning about data wrangling. I think that data wrangling is very important in the real world and I enjoy learning about the different ways in which to look and interpret data.,"Scheduling with group and trying to get everyone on the same page. I think this is just the nature of working with others and trying to get the project started, but personally it is somewhat frustrating trying to schedule and get a hold of everyone with little effort given back.",,,,,
Learning about using data science software,I would prefer if quizzes were released after the 9:00am lecture,,,,,
"I have enjoyed learning about various visualization principles of data analysis and how to improve my thought process during the data science project pipeline in areas, such as ethics.","It would be great for the group project to not be randomly assigned but rather determined by skillset, so each team would have a couple people who know how to code, others who are more creative, etc.",,,,,
I like the setup of the project.,Wish we learnt more about statistical methods that can be used,,,,,
"I really like digging through documentation to learn about libraries, I feel that it's really fun to iterate through different methods of going about manipulating data and it's really satisfying when what you wanted to accomplish finally works","I feel that a portion of the assignments have code written for us and is often confusing to understand what it actually does without struggling with it for awhile, I especially wish that we had more practice with data acquisition and cleaning as it's done for us.",,,,,
The data wrangling and manipulation as well as the coding,N/A,,,,,
I loved learning about pandas and dataframes. I think Jupyter Notebook and pandas are very powerful tools for data visualization and these are both technologies that I haven't worked with before.,I think the project groups should've been formed earlier so we can get started earlier and have more time to finish.,,,,,
Applying the basic concept from COGS 9 and managing dataset in coding is fun!,Comparatively concept heavy material is my least favorite as I enjoy learning more actively learning required material like playing around with datasets or generating figures.,,,,,
I've enjoyed the assignments because they're structured in such a way that I can learn data science skills through the completion of them,The group project as I don't like working in assigned groups as it can lead to a mismatch in skills and more importantly effort levels.,,,,,
I've enjoyed the lectures. I think they are entertaining and easily digestible.,"I am generally struggling with assignments, but that could just be a me thing. I am used to having programming classes where there are tutor hours that I can go to for debugging rather than having labs. Unfortunately, I mostly only have time to get most of my work done on the weekend and it feels scary to not have a synchronous help option then. Also, am used to pair programming more, so maybe that's why I'm struggling more.",,,,,
Working on a team,Some of the instructions for assignments can't be a bit unclear sometimes. There are so many ways to do one problem,,,,,
Getting more experience with Pandas. I have enjoyed the assignments and love solving coding problems.,"The group project feels like it has gone from 0 to 100 really quickly. Half of our group had not met or contributed anything until our meeting three days ago, so the pace that we will need to keep for this project worries me.",,,,,
"I really enjoy working through the assignments, I feel like I learn so much about python and data science",I did feel a little intimidated by some of the projects we reviewed and their code,,,,,
Group working with my fellow group-mates.,Quizzes.,,,,,
I really enjoyed learning about various tools we can use in data science such as the various python libraries. I also enjoyed learning about how to make informative and professional data visualizations.,So far nothing stands out particularly. I don't enjoy group projects that much but I think its good practice working with a group.,,,,,
I enjoyed learning about how to use pandas and data visualizations because those concepts are very applicable to my summer internship as a business analyst.,"I like least about the random assignment of groups for the final project because before working together effectively, it takes time to get to know each other and everyone's working style. Although it is a good opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone, working with people I'm less familiar with takes me more time to produce a high-quality result with my team.",,,,,
"The organization of assignments, discussions, etc.",The amount of redundancy in coding.,,,,,
Welcoming lecture and helpful staff.,A little confusion with some homework problems.,,,,,
It's been fun to review python since its been a bit and apply it to a question my group came up with.,I don't have anything I particularly dislike.,,,,,
I like the assignments! I feel like Im learning about python which Ive never used before!,"The group project feels daunting. But, I also am excited to hopefully have something cool to put on my resume, so I don't feel awful. It's just a bit anxiety provoking.",,,,,
"Understanding the process behind data science. I like learning about why we do certain things beforehand, the implications of data science projects, etc.",The actual coding part. It all goes through one ear out the other.,,,,,
I have enjoyed doing the coding labs as I find them to be very stress free and learn from them,I have least liked the group projects as I'm not a huge fan of group work in general. It can be hard at times to find matching schedules and be constantly in communication with everyone,,,,,
Working with different people that I do not know before on some things that we all like in common.,"The class is too early in the morning, sometime it is hard to make it to the class.",,,,,
working with pandas and data wrangling,"datahub/juypter notebook, it can act up sometimes",,,,,
"Lectures about data used in real-world examples, ""stories"" about data, and the guest lecture.","Using Github, Github desktop, etc.

Every aspect of the class is nice except using Github and cloning, pushing, pulling, committing, etc.",,,,,
"Yes. I think the topics covered so far in class are pretty interesting such as different methods for data visualization, useful methods in pandas etc.",Nothing I don't like so far(maybe the 9:00 AM lecture lol coz I have to get up early),,,,,
I enjoy reading the previous projects. I saw a lot of interesting topics and those inspired me a lot.,I think so far everything is good.,,,,,
I have liked the the jupyter notebook and assignments because they are quite useful and conducive to my learning. I also like that there are quite a few EC opportunities,There's not really anything I haven't liked,,,,,
I definitely have enjoyed learning about the data science process and formulating a data science project for the final project.,"Too many assignments each week, I wish we could've combined some assignments to make it easier to keep track of what I need to complete on a week to week basis.",,,,,
Learning about the concepts on how to make visualizations and using data using code has been the most enjoyable part of this course.,"I don't like how much work there is, especially with the amount of assignments that are piled on for this class (i.e. having to do all discussion labs and assignments and quizzes in a week). Also, I don't like having assigned groups when there are people who aren't responsive and don't take responsibility because it feels hopeless in what to do when people don't want to pull their weight.",,,,,
I've really enjoyed applying what I've learned in lecture into actual assignments and seeing myself become more confident with data visualizations,"I think I would have preferred picking groups for the final project over being assigned random groups, but my group is still really nice",,,,,
"How it is diversifying my idea of working with data. I am used to just coding and working with datasets, but I never learned anything else about how to work with data. Being able to see what makes a data set good and how to ask questions has been enjoyable to learn.",Finding time to meet up with my group. I feel like because everyone has their own lives and sleeping schedules/ work schedules it is sometimes difficult to allocate time to work on the projects. Also because our meetings tend to last longer than expected so it cuts into all of our other plans.,,,,,
I think the project aspect - I got a great group and we are working on an interesting topic!,The weekly labs - they feel a bit tedious to get through.,,,,,
I enjoyed learning about what each graph type is used for,the lecture content does not help in completing the lsbs and assignments,,,,,
Probably the assignments because I enjoy applying our learning and using it to work on the assignments,"Nothing so far, I feel like I have enjoyed everything about COGS 108 as of right now",,,,,
I have enjoyed doing the clicker questions. They have been engaging.,I am not really sure what I least like so far.,,,,,
The labs and assignment are interesting to complete,Everything is great so far,,,,,
The Discussion labs are very engaging.,"In person attendance being part of a grade is difficult for me as I live a few cities away in SD county, so I'm just taking the loss of percentage to save on money haha.",,,,,
"I enjoyed learning more about data in general, and what exactly can be done to make data easily digestible for people.",Trying to teach myself python at the same time. I feel like I'm always behind and much of the work takes a lot of studying and referencing other sources to figure out what's going on - but this is due to me not knowing Python.,,,,,
I like the pace of this class. It's very decently paced as opposed to DSC 10.,There are two assignments and a quiz due every week.,,,,,
Able to use what we learned in this class and before in python to really work out a data science baed project.,Working with random group members on big projects. It is difficult to communicate sometimes and wok together as we don't know each other before.,,,,,
I enjoyed doing python because it is a really useful tool and we could use this in our work.,"I don't like the theoretical part because theoretical stuff is hard for me to understand. But I understand that it's necessary for the class to help us understand data science in many perspectives, not just about data.",,,,,
"I've enjoyed Discussions and Assignments so far, as they have helped me understand the material better for this semester.","So far, group communication and planning for the project has not been great, as some of my group members have not been engaged with the process so far.",,,,,
The thing I liked the most about COGS 108 so far has been learning how to manipulate data to make it easier to visualize and use.,"I don't think I have anything that I dislike about COGS 108, I enjoy all of the class.",,,,,
I enjoy the content—it's really interesting to learn about data science for the first time and the way Professor Ellis teaches makes it really interactive. I also appreciate all the visualizations and detailed slides that make it easy to follow along with course content. I also appreciate my group for being really proactive and easy to work and communicate with thus far. I'm excited to create a full project with them and learn more about data science throughout the course.,"I think sometimes some of the labs are difficult to complete. Although I know that it is intentionally vague and that some concepts are things we didn't go over and are supposed to search online for, sometimes I struggle for a long time without step by step instruction. Because there's also multiple ways to do something, oftentimes when I look online, they'll give solutions that are much lengthier and more confusing than necessary. I completely understand that this is part of the whole process, but I'd say this has been the most frustrating part of this class.",,,,,
"I have enjoyed thinking about and starting to work on the project. I think it's a really good opportunity to practice the skills we've learned, and I also really like the freedom we get to choose whatever problem we want to work on.","I find many of the discussion assignments to be ambiguous. For example, the congress workbook had lots of parts where it was not very clear what we should plot, since much of the language about e.g. ""broken down by"", was unclear.",,,,,
I have really enjoyed learning the effectiveness of python's pandas module. I have know a bit of python but have never worked on it for data science related purposes and if I needed to store data I would store it in a dictionary or list. This give me another tool to improve my ability in python.,I find that sometimes the assignments/discussion may be a bit vague as to what is being asked of me. While I am able to use the expected test results as a guideline it would be beneficial if the instruction were clear enough for me to not have to resort to that.,,,,,
"I have enjoyed learning about Data Science. I am a computer science major. Hence, prior to the course, my knowledge on the subject was very small. But, it has been amazing to see the clear, significant impact data science has created on society.","The amount of work. I think there is a lot of assigned tasks which make it difficult to focus on the project. It is very time-consuming to focus on the quizzes, discussion work, and assignments along with the group project assignments. For example, this week was very difficult because we had three personal assignments and needed to decide a research topic with our groups/create a proposal. 

A solution I propose is having a week to only think about the research and just submit the question in a google form style. Then, the next week assign the proposal.",,,,,
I enjoyed getting with the group and discussing about the project. We get know our classmates,I liked the quizzes the least. Some questions were confusing,,,,,
Assignments - Very fun and informative,Discussion - Sometimes a bit too complicated at times,,,,,
the lecture,not really,,,,,
"The lectures are digestible, not too much work outside of class, professor is nice and understand, and we're building on what we're learning.",I keep forgetting to bring my iClicker with me and am showing up to lectures without getting any participation credit...,,,,,
"Learning about the different processes of data science, like data wrangling and data analysis","Group work, can be frustrating at times to coordinate with everyone, especially when everything we've done together has been online and individualized",,,,,
The assignments on jupyter hub,the group project with random classmates has been hard to coordinate since no one is that responsive,,,,,
The format of Jupyter Notebook works very well for my style of learning,"Most classes largely cover topics I already know, but I am also coming into this class with a lot of prior knowledge",,,,,
I like how I don't have to go to lecture :),I don't like how we can't pick our groups for project :(,,,,,
I enjoy the concepts learned in Cogs 108 so far and understand the fundamentals of processing data with many methods.,"It might be the group work. We're a little behind, but this could be from all of us having a heavy week last, but still were hoping to start more work this upcoming week.",,,,,
"I have enjoyed the guest lecture, it was very engaging.","Not having a hybrid option during rainy days. I understand that we have up to 5 days to skip, but the rain lasted a couple lectures and it would've been more convenient to have that option. But I still appreciate the amount of days you give to skip!",,,,,
I have really enjoyed the coding labs and lectures. I think that the lectures go by very fast becuase they are at a really good pace and the coding labs are a good length,I think having Assignments and coding labs is a little redundant and the assignments are lengthy when I would rather put that time towards the project,,,,,
I enjoyed how the quizzes is on the weekend instead of the weekdays as I always stress about the stuff that is due on weekday with classes and other work. Having online quizzes for the weekend is great for me and my schedule.,The least part about COGS 108 is the discussion work as some of them was confusing and not having all the test case available to us is also kinda annoying because I wanted to double check my work before submitting.,,,,,
"Analyzing data by using DataFrame and statistical graphics, which helps me explore and understand more about my data",The hidden tests since I lost points and didn't know why even though my code ran through valid,,,,,
Doing code,nothing too bad,,,,,
"I enjoy being able to learn new Python library, panda, as I can use it outside of class for my research.",I dislike how the assignments are once every other week but is opened the week that is due. This makes it uneven in terms of work load and rather it be opened for 2 weeks so the work doesn't pile up.,,,,,
iClicker questions,sometimes the labs and assignments have really vague/ambiguous descriptions on the task and that makes me struggle to understand what it wants me to do,,,,,
The homework is not difficult.,The groups are randomly assigned.,,,,,
interesting assignments and enthusiastic instructors,nothing yet,,,,,
I've enjoyed learning how to use a new language and getting comfortable with the libraries.,The organization of the class. The group project feels very disconnected from the class itself and it's a bit disorienting.,,,,,
Lab session. Go through codes and explain in detail.,N/A,,,,,
It's learning Python with a good professor,collaborative assignments with group.,,,,,
"Class is well structured, all quizzes and assignments were posted in datahub, which make submission very easy","Nothing, so far so good",,,,,
Learning how to analyze datasets,Some assignment questions too complicated,,,,,
"I enjoyed the lecture about data visualization the most, because I liked highlighting the differences between visualizations when using the same data",Using datahub; it has been inconsistent in saving my progress in assignments and discussions.,,,,,
I enjoyed practicing how to use GitHub because I have not done much git pull and committing in the way we have done so far for this class.,I have been disliking how the questions in the labs and assignments sometimes sound like riddles. I find myself sitting there at my computer spending more time wondering what the question is asking me to do than actually writing the code.,,,,,
"I think learning about EDA in general is pretty interesting, and It's something I haven't learned before as an ECON major.","Well, I understand why we get assigned teammates for the group project, and in real life it is indeed that we don't have choices. But just for this class, I still liked the least about being unable to choose my own teammates.",,,,,
I have enjoyed the coding/data wrangling content the most.,I think that the discussion assignments can become tedious at times even after using course/online resources to write code.,,,,,
"Coming from a limited Java background, learning about python has been really enjoyable as I've found that I actually quite enjoy working through the datasets for the homeworks.",I wish we could've spent a little more time recapping python basics and having relevant methods that aren't talked about in class mentioned a bit more on the assignment instructions.,,,,,
I think it's interesting to work in a group of people with different backgrounds and skills,I think that maybe groups could've been assigned slightly earlier in the quarter so we had more time to figure it out with groups.,,,,,
I have enjoyed the lectures. I have found that its been 3+ years since I have done anything related to python so this is a nice refresher.,I have found the discussion assignments and the actual assignments really repetitive because they are generally the same assignments.,,,,,
"I have really enjoyed learning the basics of github. I've used the internet for a long time, and have heard of / sparingly used github to download files for programs that I've used a lot in the past, but truthfully I've never used it myself to host any repositories. Learning the basics of forking, committing, and pushing has been fun, even just editing a jupyter notebook and pushing my changes for the project proposal was a pretty cool feeling.","I struggle a bit with the assignments, but I wouldn't say that I don't like the process of tackling the problem and figuring out solution.",,,,,
Working on the project with my team has been fun. As group seems to be very organized and on the same page which has made the progression of our project a lot more smooth.,Nothing,,,,,
learned more about pandas,"I think groups can be divided based on topics of interest. I hope this final project will be beneficial for my future work and life. However, being assigned to very random groups means that each person's interests may not align well, leading to members who are not sensitive to the topic being unable to fully engage. I understand that in future work, employees cannot choose the content of their work, but I believe that schools can provide a platform for students to fully immerse themselves in topics they are genuinely interested in, considering there are decades of mandatory work content waiting for students to complete in the future",,,,,
I have enjoyed the assignments and labs because they connect well to each other and are reflective of what we are learning on lecture.,The thing I like the least about COGS 108 is the group project because the groups were randomly assigned.,,,,,
The most enjoyable part has been working on the COGS 108 project as I felt like I have a lot of freedom and I can choose what topic I want to work on instead of being forced to do something.,There is not a part of COGS 108 that I do not like as I feel like the class in very manageable.,,,,,
The assignments have been easy to access and with the combination of discussions and assignments it has been easy to learn the code,"So far, the trajectory of the project seems unclear to me, but I feel like that's only because that's more focussed on towards the end of the quarter",,,,,
I enjoy that I get to explore the applications of Python it's something that I really enjoy doing in my free time and I'm glad the course is geared towards that.,I really enjoy the course so far but the 9 AM lecture time is not my favorite (I'm not a morning person at all).,,,,,
"I like the labs and stuff, I have never done data science and its fun seeing my code come out in a way that I can see (charts and things)","I don't like how much is due every Sunday. I wished that instead of having a lab due every week, it was only due the weeks where there wasn't an exam.",,,,,
I loved learning about the pandas library and all of the ways to manipulate Data frames with other python api's and packages,"The weekly quizzes, they really just stress me out.",,,,,
What I have enjoyed the most about COGS 108 is learning about data wrangling and how to manipulate data to get inferences and observations from them.,What I have liked least about COGS 108 is nothing actually! I have enjoyed every single aspect of the course so far.,,,,,
"I enjoyed the discussion labs most, since I feel like I learn a lot from them.","I don't really like anything least, but I do wish I could choose my COGS 108 group since I took this class with a few friends and we wanted to do a project together.",,,,,
"Yes, I enjoy that this class is very flexible and I can attend any of the lab session.",There is nothing that I particularly don't like but I feel like I already know most of the content from DSC 10.,,,,,
"How clear the lectures are. I'm a data science major and although I am familiar with a lot of the content that is covered, I enjoy how understandable lectures are and taught in a way that is understandable by everyone.","The instructions on discussion and assignment notebooks are often not clear, making it extremely hard to understand what is being asked and what should be done. Directions can be interpreted in different ways.",,,,,
"I have enjoyed seeing more applicable assignments compared to most of my classes, a lot of these work I do I feel like I could do in the real world in a logical manner to get an expected result.","Not much honestly, I would like to know what hidden test cases are after I submit (once deadline passes), or if that is already possible- more clarity on how to find that.",,,,,
Assignment Clear rubric,We are randomly assigned for teammates in group project.,,,,,
I have really enjoyed working with python and getting to learn more about how to use pandas!,"Because I do not have much experience with python, I feel that I have been struggling quite a bit on getting the hang of everything.",,,,,
Cogs108 is an interesting and useful class in which I can learn a lot about handling stats by using python,Maybe the weekly quiz since the time for the quiz is very limited.,,,,,
The discussion labs help introduce new concepts in a low stakes way and encourage me to try out new things.,"There are inconsistencies in lecture notes that have affected my quiz grades. For example, conditionals were described as *always* having an if-else format, which would mean that you technically don't use conditionals to query a data frame (instead you would just use a boolean expression in square brackets).",,,,,
learning how to organize and represent datasets,Long assignments,,,,,
"I've enjoyed learning skills that will (hopefully) benefit me and my career in the future. Lectures have been interesting so far, as have some assignments/labs.","It feels very overwhelming so far. I have coding experience with COGS 18 and a small amount of MATLAB but the final project seems like something so far out of my reach, and it seems like my group for the project feels pretty much the same way. It's mostly the coding aspect that seems so daunting, although I do believe that we will be able to get a good grade in the end.

Additionally, with the assignments and labs I feel like there has been questions with confusing wording. Sometimes it's really hard for me to figure out what exactly the question is asking of me, or what my final product should even look like. Piazza has been a good help for this though.",,,,,
Doing the labs,"Some of the instructions in the labs are not very clear, so sometimes, it is kind of hard to know what exactly we are asked to do.",,,,,
The way we submit our assignments.,I think some questions are too wordy. Just tell me what to do or how to do.,,,,,
The assignments,The quizzes,,,,,
Being able to code in assignments and them being somewhat challenging,There are some questions on discussions/assignments that are unclear so it makes it difficult to do them,,,,,
"Working in group projects is fun, and I enjoy working through the process of building a strong data science question with my team. Also, having all of the assignments be through data hub is super convenient and being able to work through them / upload them all right there makes it really easy.",Probably completing the assignments. I've done the lower division data science sequence and so redoing a lot of the same pandas stuff is just kind of a pain.,,,,,
I have enjoyed the project group and collaborative experience. Its fun to see how data science is in a more applicable hands on setting that is a little less structured.,The flip side of the last question the one thing I don't like its feeling as if I have no clue how to do the ML algorithms present in the example final projects,,,,,
Learning about how to use libraries.,I don't think there was anything I didn't enjoy.,,,,,
I've enjoyed learning about the data science industry through real industry professionals coming on to share their experience in guest lectures.,"For D2, I spent a bit more time than I thought I would've needed to on the work because I was searching documentation for wrangling. Then I worked on A2 and realized that everything I needed in D2 was written and explained in A2. It's mostly my fault for not checking beforehand but including the explanations on the labs as well or at least a pointer to the assignments could be really helpful.",,,,,
It is a fun class and useful python programming basics,The final project tasks and lay out is somehow confusing,,,,,
Working with my team on our class project and working out what we wanted to do and what strategies we were going to use.,The really vague instructions for the labs.,,,,,
"What I've enjoyed most about COGS 108 so far is the fascinating journey of learning how to analyze new datasets and performing a wide array of operations on them. This process is not just about handling data; it's about uncovering stories hidden within numbers and patterns, translating abstract figures into concrete insights that can inform decisions, innovations, and understandings about human cognition and behavior.

The hands-on experience with real-world datasets is particularly exhilarating. Each dataset presents its unique challenges and learning opportunities, making the experience akin to solving a new puzzle every time. From cleaning data to ensure its quality and usability, to exploring it through visualizations that highlight underlying trends and anomalies, every step is a step towards a deeper understanding of both the data and the tools used to analyze it.","Despite the excitement of learning new tools and methods, the initial phase of getting comfortable with libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn, has been challenging. The pace at which new concepts are introduced sometimes feels overwhelming, especially when trying to juggle other coursework and commitments.",,,,,
I've enjoyed the discussion labs the most as I feel that I learn the best from those.,I've liked the workload the least in COGS 108 as I feel that this is a work heavy course and that there are a lot of assignments that I need to be aware of.,,,,,
"I love the teaching of the professor, I think she is super passionate about teaching and she is very easy to reach out to.",None,,,,,
"I have enjoyed the course being project based, since I feel this is a more accurate representation of one's abilities and knowledge in a course than an exam.","I have liked working in a group the least. My group members like to do everything the day it is due and it is incompatible with my schedule. I would appreciate if we were able to have the option to make our own groups, so I could be with others that have a similar work ethic to me.",,,,,
I am grateful for how I still got back to the course after missing the waitlist pre-authorize process. Professor Ellis is nice and caring.,Random groups. I understand working with random people is how it is in work space but working with people I know on a project together is so much more enjoyable and easier.,,,,,
I like how the assignments are on jupyter notebooks. It makes it a more practical learning experience to complete the assignments on there and it's a lot easier with a configured environment to do work on. And there being discussion and assignments give me more chances to be confident in my skills.,"I don't like the group project aspect personally because even though it's a imitation of real life work and gives us good project experience, it is hard to coordinate as it's a class and not a work environment, and the projects can vary a lot which personally I like more order in.",,,,,
The powerpoint and fast process of lectures,none,,,,,
"The project we just started working on, I think it's good to meet different people","Datahub, it's somehow annoying to submit things on datahub instead of gradescope or canvas",,,,,
I have enjoyed all the new information I have learned so far. I also enjoyed that there are lots of examples to follow along with in class. I would say the MOST would be that we are using the same dataset from cleaning to organizing. I think that is really nice to do so it allows us to see how the data transforms and we can follow along from beginning to end.,So far the discussion activities haven't been my favorite just because it can be hard to follow at times. I have found that the discord has been helpful to get help from my peers but the discussion activities don't have much instruction so I can get confused at times. I understand that the goal of this is to get us looking around and communicating with each other but it can be frustrating at times.,,,,,
"I found that coding and data analysising are much funner than I thought. Although I'm still a bit scare of how to approach forward, it is less intimidating.",The group project for sure. My teammates are really hard to work with. They have intentionally ignored me and my inputs multiple times during the project meetings. There was one time that they start to argue with each other aggressively as well. Assigned group is really challenging for introvert people.,,,,,
"Assignment structure, it feels good to complete the assignments and that I am learning",I think it would have been more fun to choose our own groups or at least choose based on a topic.,,,,,
the fact that assignments are related to what we are going to do in final project and the entire course staff is very approachable.,"Nothing I can think of, everything seems fun.",,,,,
"I enjoy working with my group. We met once on a call and once in person, which was beneficial for exchanging ideas. Despite lacking backgrounds in data science, we each bring unique skillsets from our respective majors, enhancing our team dynamic. I appreciated the assigned teams as it alleviated the pressure of finding one.","I'll address the iClicker questions. There were instances where all the questions were clustered at the beginning, causing me to miss them, and other times when my app crashed, preventing me from answering. It's stressful because I want the extra credit.",,,,,
Having everything be posted online,Not being able to meet new people,,,,,
"I like coding in groups, I've only ever coded on my own before","The group project along with the assignments, quizes, and discussions is a lot all at once.",,,,,
I have enjoyed the guest lectures the most,nothing really. I love this course!,,,,,
I like code and Python language.,I do not like that a course need use iclicker.,,,,,
The fact that we get to work on a full fledge project hands free of any harsh rubric/instructions. I like the fact that its open ended and we get to purse whatever question we like to explore.,"While nothing really comes to mind, if I had to very picky it probably be how the Discussions are harder than the Assignments.",,,,,
The hands-on work in labs/assignments (best way to learn).,N/A,,,,,
"the Guest lecture, as we learn about real career a lot",I think everything in COGS108 is good,,,,,
"coding, I like the feeling that use the code to find the things that we need in the dataset.","explanation of the data, I don't like any kind of explanation, it just not my thing.",,,,,
Creating graphs using matplotlib and seaborn. My favorite part is being able to visualize the data and learn how to present it in different ways. It is helping me understand how important data visualization is in communication.,"I'm kind of struggling with working with my group at the moment, but I hope it will work out once the proposal is in.",,,,,
all course content has been very applicable to data science,homework assignments can feel a little lengthy,,,,,
I liked working on the group project with my group. It was fun and my group members were friendly and cooperative.,"There isn't anything in particular that I dislike. Everything is pretty good. I particularly like the Sunday due date for all assignments because I don't have to try to remember when every assignment is due, which is stressful. I wish all my classes did something like that.",,,,,
"I think the content is very interesting and easy to understand, I like working in Python and I think Jupyter Notebooks are fun to use.","Honestly, I really don't like group projects because I feel I often end up doing most of the work, but I do understand why they are necessary.",,,,,
"I have enjoyed the instruction given in the labs and assignments that allow me to follow along and practice coding. I especially liked the structure of A2, which gave clear steps to follow and explained the various functions.","Though I don't have anything I particularly disliked, so far the content I've struggled the most with is knowing which type of plot is best to use in which scenario(s). I think I get confused since all of the plots and information was given at the same time, and I didn't get sufficient practice with knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each one.",,,,,
"I've enjoyed the assignments, I feel like they have left room for people to be creative and figure things out by ourselves.",I haven't liked how early the class is because I hate waking up,,,,,
I like using Jupyterhub; it's a good tool and our coding assignments are good ways to learn what we've discussed in class. The difficulty level is fair and there is a lot of guidance throughout the assignment.,"I don't like that the published lecture content (slides & lecture notes) don't contain much information. There aren't many examples or specifics, so it's hard to go off of and I often resort to other sources to figure out the coding assignments.",,,,,
Being able to play around with a lot of different datasets and manipulating it! It has exposed me to pandas which I feel will be a valuable skill to have in the future.,Nothing in particular as of late. I think all the assignments are fair and the tasks are appropriately challenging.,,,,,
I enjoyed hearing the guest lecture and learning how to use numpy and pandas to visualize data,Some of the things in the discussions/assignments aren't covered in lecture or other material so I feel like I have to search around for it as I'm not that familiar with everything we are using in the class,,,,,
"I like, during the class, Prof explained some coding that might used in our future project and went over the project requirement in detail.",I don't really like doing group project.,,,,,
"Seeing how messy CSV file can become readable once, it feels nice that simple code can do so much",Nothing really stands out,,,,,
I have enjoyed looking at the past projects since they were very interesting,I think D3 was very stressful for me since I was really confused on what data I was supposed to wrangle and how...,,,,,
Learning python/new programming language,Statistics,,,,,
I like how everything is due Sunday at midnight so it's cohesive and I don't have to keep track of when each individual due date is.,Not being able to pick our group members. I understand it's for a study but at the same time it's the little inconveniences of having to schedule meetings use a platform everyone has even if it isn't a best and patiently waiting for everyone's response because you don't know them and don't want to come off mean.,,,,,
Thinking about a topic for our project,The time it takes to understand things on assignments and figure out why something isn't working.,,,,,
The way professor Ellis teaches is so great and engaging. I also just enjoy being able to work with others who have the same experience on coding like myself and not feeling pressured.,na,,,,,
I like the structure of the assignments it is organized and interesting to complete.,The quantity of tasks to do every week. Although it's a personal concern as I understand the reason for the inclusion of many different tasks every week and I appreciate the consistent deadline of midnight on Sunday. Have many tasks each week can often times be overwhelming as I'm always thinking about if I have completed them all.,,,,,
"doing projects and training python data analysis skills each week from A1,2,3 and D1,2,3",I think the quiz is boring,,,,,
The jupyter notebooks can go step by step.,I would like some more examples of manipulating seaborn and pandas,,,,,
I think the lectures are actually really fun.,"I dont have much to complain, probably I'd like for there to be an easier way to navigate between course material on canvas but that's about it.",,,,,
I enjoy looking at the data in class. It was fun to look at what people estimate and respond to question like how many days would it take to walk from here to New York City.,There's nothing I don't like in this class!,,,,,
Final Project,Some Discussion and Assignment questions feel very unclear,,,,,
"The coding assignments as I'm learning a lot about pandas and just working with datasets so far, which is what I really wanted to learn. I think working through the assignments and discussion assignments is really fun because of how well formatted the notebooks are!","nothing much but if i had to say one, it would probably the group project since I enjoy working alone, but so far everyone has been nice and I like my group and the project so far!",,,,,
"The guest appearances, I really enjoy guests talking about their experiences in work and the job application process with tips.","The clicker questions. I was unable to come to a significant portion of lectures due to this quarter's weather conditions, so I was unable to come to most of them and participate.",,,,,
Learning Pandas,N/A,,,,,
I enjoy the most on learning how to use python to create data frames to have a better understanding of the data we have.,"I like the least on the graph that we need to plot, because I am very good at them, but I will try my best to improve my skills on them.",,,,,
I enjoyed the data visualization lecture. I think making plots is the most interesting and fun thing I've learned so far.,"I''m not sure if theres anything I've really disliked about the course so far. I do find using github challenging because it is completely new to me, and transferring files for the group project can be difficult for me.",,,,,
I like the assignments as they are very representative of the lectures.,I really dislike the quizzes because I sometimes forget to take them.,,,,,
The homeworks that help us ease into using the functions we learned in a real-world manner,The weekly quizzes that ask us both very general and specific questions,,,,,
I learned a lot about the data using python. I have applied concepts like importing and cleaning the data. I enjoyed creating graphs and model it.,I think the least favorite about Cogs 108 so far is using datahub and jupiter notebook. It disconnect a lot and slow as well.,,,,,
I have enjoyed learning about pandas and seaborn as it has actually helped me on other computer science classes that I am taking right now so I am extremely happy that this class has already helped me succeed.,Sometimes the labs/assignments have instructions that are a bit too vague like in D4 there were some code blocks that I did not know what to fill out because the instructions were not too clear,,,,,
"I think is the programming language part, because it’s really useful and easy to follow.","So far, I think everything is fine. I don’t have anything don’t like yet.",,,,,
Working with team mates as I am learning new things from each person,too many assignments due each sunday,,,,,
Coding in the notebooks. Passing the checks are fun,Having to organize group meetings can be tedious,,,,,
The many examples used to explain the subject material during lectures.,I feel that sometimes we pass over certain topics about programming methods and tools rather quickly.,,,,,
I enjoyed working with group the most so far. It was fun getting to see people of diverse backgrounds and we joked a lot and had a great time working together on the early steps of the project.,I find the lectures kind of boring since a lot of this stuff has been something I have learned already.,,,,,
The combination working on codes(technical parts) and using several case study/real life senario to explain it,I want to learn a bit more about the technical parts,,,,,
"I like how easy it is to learn in this class.The labs and assignments are challenging, but never impossible and I always finish each one walking away with something I learned.","Honestly, as a CS major taking this for an elective, I really just wanted to work with friends on the project. I feel less motivated and I care less about the project topic. I will still do my work of course, but it will be out of obligation rather than interest.",,,,,
Progressing my coding knowledge because I think it will be a very useful skill in the future even though I'm not focusing my future into any sort of software development.,I mean the speed is something that you have to get used to here at UCSD because of the quarter system but I do think that it's pretty fast which makes it difficult sometimes.,,,,,
engaging lectures with checks for understanding,lab/assignment instructions can be unclear; sometimes feeling like we have to google everything ourselves/self-teach to complete the work (concepts/methods not explained in lecture or discussion),,,,,
What I have enjoyed the most about the quarter so far is the ability of learning new things. I used to think that programming in python was complicated but now I know that that is not the case.,"The thing that I have enjoyed the least has nothing to do with the class, it has to do with the weather. My plan was to attend every single lecture in person but with the past rains it has made it hard to do so.",,,,,
I Like to work in groups. Most of my data science classes have been solo.,"I dont like how all the information is spread out through different websites, canavs, github, piazza.",,,,,
"I've enjoyed how guided the lectures and notes are because when I took CSE8A, I struggled to follow along lectures and was nervous about approaching coding, but Dr.Ellis' way of instructing makes me feel much better and confident in coding.",I don't have anything I like least about COGS 108!,,,,,
I enjoy looking at and learning about the data sets in assignments and actually learning from the data and visualizing it.,nothing,,,,,
"I think the thing I have enjoyed the most in this class so far is the content, it is very interesting learning about data science and more specifically applying coding to it.",The thing I have liked the least about this class so far is not having designated time to work on the final project.,,,,,
"It doesn't have heavy work, and everything is on the track for me.",N/A,,,,,
many hands on experience and example of actual use case and application on real world data,too much work,,,,,
"the assignments, because they're fun & not that difficult","the group project, i don't like talking to random people & it's been kinda stressful so far trying to coordinate with them",,,,,
Definitely discussions and assignments. These helped me to have a deep understanding of the class materials.,Group work so far. There's no problem with my group but I personally do not like group work in general.,,,,,
Learning about how to use an manipulate data especially with pandas and using more logic than code to show how one thing relates to another,The lectures go over general topics but I think practical problems that can be solved in class and then talked about with a partner and then explained by you would help us understand the topics better,,,,,
I like the pace of the content,My group project has a lot of different majors so working together is harder than expected,,,,,
"I have enjoyed the group project. I have been pleasantly surprised by how well each of us get along, especially given that the groups are randomly assigned. Moreover, I love the freedom we have in choosing our research topic.","The weekly quiz, discussions, and assignments are a little bit stressful to keep up with each week.",,,,,
The lectures have been interesting.,The assignments are difficult so I have least enjoyed them.,,,,,
Learning how to use python in a different application than I was taught (I learned Python through CSE 8a) and it's just fascinating in general to see data generated and visualized.,"Sometimes it's a bit confusing to remember the parameters that need to be passed for different functions, and also confusing to remember which functions belong to what libraries or which ones will be best to use.",,,,,
"The consistent support, and warmth that the instructional staff has provided me. I was away for 2 weeks but I have received support tat goes above and beyond and I thank everyone for that.",The lack of structured information and instruction on pandas and seaborn has really left me confused at times regarding assignments.,,,,,
Working on the project ideas with my team,Discussion PA's,,,,,
very interesting new subject that is applicable to all fields,coding,,,,,
Learning through the demo coding in class,"Discussion homework, it is time consuming.",,,,,
Being able to apply what we're learning in lecture in both the labs and assignments. I really enjoy lectures and think they're paced well with a good balance of material.,The assigned group project - I truly would have had such a better experience being able to pick a group or just work by myself.,,,,,
I have enjoyed the Labs the most as well as working in a group for our project.,There is nothing,,,,,
Data visualization. I've never used the seaborn library and hadn't delved too much into data vis before now.,"The pacing seems off in my opinion. I feel that most of what we've learned so far has not prepared us to produce a final project--at the time of writing that is. So far we've only really covered basic pandas operations data vis, and some statistics concepts.",,,,,
Coding!!,This class is perfect. Nothing don't like.,,,,,
"Office hours with Professor Shannon, she is very comfortable to be around and helpful for those who need help","Trying to collaborate with teammates for the project; I don't mean to call out my teammates, but I feel like it is hard to meet at a time when everyone is available.",,,,,
"I enjoy learning about examples of data science projects, because it introduces me to things I haven't thought about.",Finding good data for our topic was a challenge.,,,,,
The assignments are quite engaging and helpful!,I felt like some of the quiz questions were a bit vague.,,,,,
i feel like the assignments and discussion coding has been fun so far!,"the group project is a bit tough just due to the lack of structure, I previously took cse110 before and we had designated group leaders which made it easier as they helped delegate the work. I know it could backfire if some leaders were too bossy for example, but I think I'd prefer being able to be told what needs to be done as opposed to the whole group kind of lost and willing to do whatever on their own.",,,,,
The coding because it is fun,Making graphs,,,,,
I like doing the labs and assignments the most,I like the lecture quizzes the least because they're not as fun,,,,,
Drawing pictures and visualizing data. It is very practical.,Github. It is too messy to work with.,,,,,
I enjoyed learning about python and pandas. I think this is very useful for my career in the future.,"The part I least enjoyed was learning how to plot. To me, plotting is not intuitive and takes a long time for me to understand.",,,,,
the project and freedom to choose our own topic,random teammate,,,,,
yeas,the learning of pandas library,,,,,
I really enjoyed learning about EDA and Pandas since they seem to be super useful.,"The random groups were a bummer, since I really wanted to work with my friends on the final project.",,,,,
I’ve really enjoyed how the lectures are structured and furthering out learning about things we got to see in our discussion labs.,What i’ve liked the least is not necessarily too hard but it’s all i could think of : learning how to navigate github with my group for the first time. I think i’ll get the hang of it after using it more often now that we’re starting project proposals,,,,,
The assignments on jupyter notebook have been pretty engaging and interesting,The extra credit offered in the class could be increased by a bit,,,,,
"My favorite part so far has been doing the labs and the guest lecturer. I really like how they were somewhat challenging but not overwhelming, and I got to practice with the concepts we learned in class. I also really liked being able to hear from a real data scientist.","If I had to say something, I disliked jupyter notebooks the least with how slow it takes to run code can be a little frustrating.",,,,,
Deal with different kind of datasets,group project,,,,,
The use of real world skills,A lot of things toi be keeping track of,,,,,
"I have enjoyed the format of the class. I also enjoyed the use of the notebooks to help me learn Python, as I have always struggled with learning programming languages.","It has been hard to keep up with the material. However, I have been trying my best to catch up. The project looks like a lot of fun though!",,,,,
The labs are fun and coming up with our own project is also fun.,Clicker credit to get EC instead of a live/free website,,,,,
I have enjoyed the part that was discussing the data intuition in which I learned about the myth of power of ten,I think data manipulation is the least I like for the class because I have no prior experience in panda,,,,,
"learning more about working with pandas, numpy, seaborn, and other libraries in python.",N/A,,,,,
I like to spend time learning new coding methods.,Probably hard to find a time to group with the groupmates.,,,,,
"I love how much practice we get with coding, such as in the discussion labs and in the assignments.",It was a little hard to formulate a research question and find appropriate datasets but we figured it out.,,,,,
Labs!! The labs are so interesting and easy to understand. You could see the cleaning and the visualizations so nicely! The labs are also very instructive so we know what we are retrieving.,"It's not what I liked least, but more so hardest part is probably thinking of an effective, data-driven research question for our final topic. My group initially had ""How does the rise of automation influence the skills needed to keep a job?"" (something along those lines) However, the datasets we found were all very web-scrappy and since the issue is still so new, we couldn't find raw data. A lot of the web-scrappy parts were finalized data. We tried to reverse psychology their findings by going through their references but didn't find anything at all.",,,,,
Data visualizations. Experimenting with the ways the data can be plot onto a graph is pretty fun and interesting.,"Working in a team. I'd rather have less or same amount of work for myself, since I know if I miss a deadline, it is entirely my fault, and I don't have to rely on other people either not responding or couldn't make the deadline for one reason or another.",,,,,
I have enjoyed learning about how data can be safely and ethically used. I think this is very important because it teaches me how to responsibly use data,The submission system is kind of annoying.,,,,,
"Prof Ellis' material is delivered in a super approachable and practical manner, which is a refreshing change.",Why are the weekly lecture quizzes released Friday afternoon? I work really hard during the week so I can enjoy my weekends and I would prefer to take the quiz immediately after Friday morning lecture at 0955.,,,,,
accessible information,Heavy workload.,,,,,
"Lecture style is very enjoyable. I am happy to be in an intro class that finally feels like an intro class. Where new concepts are being explained in class and even surrounding topics are also elaborated on, rather than others were they throw you right in.",Possibly the multiple modalities for the class/homework material to be in. Sometimes you have to really search to find the exact course material you wanted. But no big complaints truly!,,,,,
I have enjoyed doing the discussion coding assignments because it really is more focused on learning rather than being graded. I feel like I can code for fun and not for a grade,"I do not like how we have several assignments every other week and it can easily pile up. It tends to be piled on when other classes get busy as well. For example, one week is really light and easy and the next week we have a quiz, discussion assignment, our actual assignment, and then we have to also work on our projects.",,,,,
"The ability to work remotely, this has been a huge help given I have had to do a lot of travelling for my family this quarter.","The group project, I completely understand why we do it in groups, but I just in general do not enjoy doing group work.",,,,,
the discussion projects,not being able to choose project groups,,,,,
i think that the group project has had an interesting and promising start,i don't like how i can't see how well i did on the weekly quizzes after i do them,,,,,
I mostly have enjoyed learning more about python and being able to put it to practice in labs and assignments.,I don't really have anything I dislike about the class.,,,,,
"I like that all the assignments are due Sunday night so it is easy to keep track of, I also like that the instructions for projects are very clear.",I didn't like that groups were assigned as I would've liked it better if we could choose or had the option to choose to be assigned if not.,,,,,
I have really enjoyed the group project so far as it has allowed my group and I to ask a analysis question that interests us.,I sometimes feel some of the wording for some assignment/discussion questions is too ambiguous and some could be refined to be more specific of what the question is asking mostly with proper formatting for the answers.,,,,,
I have enjoyed using datahub and the jupyterhub notebook to complete these assignments compared to other classes.,I don't like how we were randomly sorted into groups for the group project.,,,,,
I enjoyed the overall lecture experience and knowledge about data science. I haven't really come across using data in the way this class is structured. I think it's interesting knowing how there is so many elements you have to considered when doing a research question.,"I don't really have any negative experience so far for the course, or anything that I least like.",,,,,
"What I have enjoyed the most about COGS 108 so far has been being able to learn about data science while also being able to expand and grow my coding skills. This has been able to make me feel more confident in myself and my coding abilities, allowing me to be more prepared to take on future coding projects.",I would say the thing that has been the most difficult for me so far has definitely been completing the assignments for our group project as it has been challenging at times to find times to meet up and has also been stressful to trust that everyone in my group would finish their assigned parts of our group assignments.,,,,,
"Learning Pandas, I really enjoy coding and have found it fun to learn how the pandas library works.",So far I have the class slightly disorganized as I have been a little confused on how to submit assignments.,,,,,
I've enjoyed the collaborative aspect of this class. I'm not super good at coding but my group mates have helped me a lot by explaining things and guiding me through some problems.,N/A i've enjoyed this class a lot so far!,,,,,
I enjoy seeing how to be able to sort through the data. It is tough to remember but I am starting to understand it more.,"Some of the questions on the assignments are tough, but that is honestly understandable and normal.",,,,,
I'm practicing solving real problems,class is too bored,,,,,
"I've enjoyed the collaborative aspect of the course. I typically dislike courses that implement group projects as the final exam/largest portion of the grade, however, I find that it's helped me feel less isolated in the course and more anchored in to the content (facilitating the course content in a practical, independent way)","The amount of deadlines in a week can be kind of stressful, as the labs, assignments, and quizzes stack on top of the group project is quite a heavy workload (with other courses in mind as well).",,,,,
I enjoy coding,I don't like randomly assigned group,,,,,
Learning all the great technique in Data Science; Collaborate with team member to build our project,Lots of things to do each week,,,,,
Course content has been quite engaging! Also lectures are great. I feel like there's a lot of time in between clicker questions for us to really think. I'm enjoying the content!,The group work unfortunately has been a bit hard. The randomness hit my group hard where some members put in the bare minimum when it comes to discussion. We've gotten far but meetings aren't as productive. I personally would enjoy selecting my team (but I am curious about the study results on random versus selecting groups goes),,,,,
I enjoyed the discussion assignments so far because they’re not too difficult to complete as long as you keep up with course content,"I think I have disliked the beginning part of the COGS project because it seemed a bit messy to contact with one another through canvas. In addition, I was personally thrown off guard about the project review assignment when I recently joined my group",,,,,
The thing I have enjoyed most about COGS 108 so far is definitely the Discussion assignments. I feel like the discussion labs lets us get a good understanding of what we learned in lecture.,"The least thing I've liked so far is the ambiguity of some of the questions on assignments and discussions. For example, with graphs specifying what columns should be x and y axis etc.",,,,,
Learning how Python works (I had no idea how to code in Python before this),Working in group projects where an individual did not really contribute :/,,,,,
Understanding how to create data visualizations and which graphs work better than others for specific tasks.,"The slightly more theoretical lectures, although they were still very interesting!",,,,,
"I love the practice we get from discussions and assignments on data science libraries! It feels like in computer science courses a lot of that work is abstracted away, so I appreciate the depth of practice.","I think some of the course content is very broad and a little vague. I wish more examples about some content (like ethics and privacy) can help to get a better understanding of what to look out for, what not to do, etc. Negative examples in general would be great.",,,,,
"I really like the labs honestly. I feel like I learn a lot in the assignment. If I'm confused I look up the operator I have to use and seeing it all workout with no penalty is super helpful and really rewarding. I'm also in another python class right now that doesn't;t use pandas and I've come to realize how much I really like pandas. This is my second pandas class (I took DSC 10) and I'm in CSE 8A right now, and I prefer pandas over typical python.","So far, I don't really have any complaints. If I HAD to pick something I'd say the assignments but it's not that I DON'T like them I'm just not the best coder so it takes me some time. Otherwise it's all good.",,,,,
I have enjoyed programming in python. Both my other major classes require me to code in C. It is definitely refreshing to work on COGS 108. The assignments and discussions have been really interesting.,"I feel that lectures are too fast, sometimes. The different concepts just fly by, so it is hard to keep up with the information being typed into the Jupyter Notebook.",,,,,
the lecture,the hw too much text to read,,,,,
Lectures - They are fun!,So far so good,,,,,
I really enjoy the fact that I can work through jupyter hub and the way the assignments walk me through every step and explains what each part of the code does.,Sometimes lines of code are not explained and I,,,,,
Learning about how to manipulate data.,"Its kind of hard to take notes and keep track of things when there are slides, jupyternotebooks, etc. Not really sure what the solution for this would be.",,,,,
I enjoy the real-world applications to the data analysis,The amount and difficulty of the homework which I find challenging,,,,,
I have really enjoyed going to lecture and learning about data science since Professor Ellis is a great lecturer. I also enjoy how the discussion help me learn to apply pandas and seaborn to dataset.,I have least liked how some questions on the labs or assignments are a little confusing or unclear about what they want me to do.,,,,,
Doing the lab and assignment really helps me improve my practical skills.,Randomly assigned teammate. The work so far doesn't proceed very well.,,,,,
"I like how I can connect concepts I've learned in the past in classes like COGS 9 to hard skills I've developed, this is most visible in the discussions and labs, where we can practice the concepts we learned through code.","I think it may be a bit difficult combining the technical side/coding aspect of the class with the conceptual, since in lecture, the conceptual aspects of data science are emphasized but it can be difficult connecting this to python concepts, which aren't as emphasized.",,,,,
I've enjoyed how complicated concepts are explained in a clear and simple way.,"Although, I do see the positives in collaborating with others, I have liked working in groups the least. I think because there's so little time to get to know one another, it's hard to discover an individual's strengths and weakness to assign them to a role that they could achieve effectively. I'm learning to explain myself and to listen more to others.",,,,,
I enjoy learning about data science! It seems really interesting.,I don't like the early times honestly.,,,,,
I love our in class experimentations on different types of graphs that describe a dataset.,That it is hard to find groupmates to do the project tgt sometimes,,,,,
I enjoy working on the group project the most since it feels like I'm putting the skills I have learned so far to test.,I like the discussions the least. I don't find them particularly helpful so far and it would be more effective if it encouraged discussion with other students.,,,,,
"How well structured the class has been, everything makes sense and new concepts come at comfortable pace.","Not having a mandatory in person meeting for our group projects, at least for the introduction.",,,,,
Understanding how to use plots and charts to make cohesive analysis of large data.,Lack of group meetings.,,,,,
The content of lectures is fun and easy to understand most of the time,Jupyter Notebook because it's very confusing to load s,,,,,
I really enjoy the lectures and how the prof explains everything in such detail,i just dont love how the assignments take so long and how there are hidden assignments that could secretly mess up my score.,,,,,
The set up of Discussion Lab and Assignments. It's very clear to go through each concept.,N/A,,,,,
The team work,the assignments are long,,,,,
The learning about pandas,The project proposal,,,,,
