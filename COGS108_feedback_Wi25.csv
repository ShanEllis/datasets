enojed_most,enjoyed_least
I like the labs and homeworks they're pretty well structured.,Nothing.
The lectures are very entertaining and a great way to teach,The discussion notebooks take a long time to finish and are a lot of work that doesn't teach much
"I have really enjoyed the further exposure to Python. I took a class using Python before but I feel like I am retaining much more information on how to use it here due to the detailed explanations provided for us in lecture, labs, and assignments. ","I think I have least liked the weekly quizzes, simply because I sometimes forget that they are there to be done. However, I understand the importance of them and I have been more mindful of incorporating the short quiz into my to-do list items. "
"What I have enjoyed the most so far in this class is the overall class structure. For a class like this, I love how we have the opportunity to form groups and work on one big project, with “checkpoints” throughout the quarter for the project and “small” assignments to complete weekly for the course materials (the quizzes and assignments). I think that is better than having midterms/finals.","This is just a personal thing, but I have had practically zilch experience with Python (I am, however, not new to programming as a whole. I was taught C++ first, followed by Java. I have my qualms with Python), but I am doing review and watching “python for c++ programmers” videos to get myself up to speed."
How thorough lectures are and accomodating the class is for students. I feel like I am learning a great deal without adding too much stress to my workload. ,I wish that discussion sections were podcasted
I've enjoyed brushing up on my pandas knowledge and I do like that the lectures themselves are quite interactive with the notebooks, n/a
"I like the discussion and assignment assignments. I like how I can apply what I learned in class to different samples and see the outcomes. Moreover, they are hands-on, so I can learn about the syntax and how to analyze data. ","Something that I didn't like as much was the grading for the assignments and discussions. Although there are test cases on the assignments, there are hidden cases that are also in the questions. Since I am trying to fulfill the question and solve for a specific test case, there are issues with the test cases that wouldn't work with the hidden ones. As  a result, I would get docked because I was trying to solve the question, rather than fulfilling the hidden case. This could be an error on my side, but I haven't understood the syntax and functions to their full extent yet, so I would find different functions that also fulfill the question, but fail the hidden tests."
Learning about the different ways of reducing or wrangling datasets.,N/A
Not so much about learning the language but the intuition of data. Understand that data can be biased and ethics about data analysis.,"Nothing much, everything is going smoothly and there are enough support."
Assignments and Discussion Labs have been straightforward and interesting.,I think the project part is a little slow because we haven't done much related to it yet.
"I've most enjoyed the satisfying way discussions and assignments are set up, along with the beneficial lectures given by prof. ellis.",I have been a little stressed about the slow pace of getting the project started because I have become more accustomed to a faster paced project-based class (like cogs 137). But even that is okay
"I enjoy the class a lot, there are great examples in lecture that help me understand the material. ",I don't have anything I like the least. 
Professor Ellis does a really good job explaining things and articulating concepts.,The quizzes feel like an added stress when we have a lab and assignment due.
the specializations per week and the teaching staff's openness to questions,I wish we had more places to practice and code more
I have enjoyed the assignments. As a data science major I feel like I’m getting extra practice from both this class and my data science classes so I really understand the content.,I have no complaints so far. Everything is fine
Meeting new people and refreshing my mind about python.,It feels kind of slow because I already learned most of the material.
I have enjoyed this class a lot which is surprising because data science and coding is not my strong suit. I am motivated to learn in this class because Prof Ellis makes lectures engaging and keeps the class well organized. I like the fact that we have in class surveys because it motivates me to not only just go to class but also to pay attention. I also appreciate the structure of the class. Everything is well organized I know what is due and when it is due which allows me to always have my own schedule revolving when to get my work done.,Since coding is not my strong suit the labs and assignments can get a little tricky for me sometimes. Being able to run through my code and validate it is very helpful. I don't particularly like the hidden tests but I understand why are they are put in place. 
I enjoy how structured the class is. It's very clear when things are due and what is expected of us. I also appreciate the reminders at the beginning of each lecture.,I wish we could see our quiz answers/scores sooner (I understand how that might not be possible for weeks with free response questions that need to be manually graded).
"One thing that I have enjoyed the most about COGS 108 is how helpful Professor Ellis is during office hours; the professor alone makes this class much more enjoyable and for students who do not have much prior coding experience, much less intimidating.","As of right now, I cannot think about anything that I liked the least about COGS 108. I find the workload to be do-able and the content interesting."
The in class participation/real time data analyses have been fun and informative,"I don't enjoy using datahub and ed, it's annoying to use these things for only one class "
"I’ve enjoyed learning about how specifically to use programming to clean up data sets, leading to an answer for an important question.","I had very little programming experience before this class, so having to get used to coding again has been very time consuming."
"The content has been fun. Data science is completely new to me, so it's interesting to learn about data, even though it seems intimidating and extremely tedious.","I don't really like Data Hub. Since it's my first data science class, I'm new to it, and it can get really annoying waiting for cells to run at times, but that's about it."
"So far I have enjoyed learning about the different visualizations and using Pandas the most. While I have experience in coding, I have not experienced using code for data visualizations. I found this interesting and engaging.","I liked the quizzes the least. Compared to the discussions and assignments, I feel that they don’t go as in depth."
"I like the lab assignments. They are short, easy to understand, and honestly have helped me learn the code better. ","Github...Only because some of the interface is kind of confusing, but since it is important for the final project, I am getting used to usign it. "
I liked the pace of the lecture and how its preparing us for the projects,"For some discussions, some of the TA/IAs dont give information to help with assignments or labs but rather just sit there dont do anything. But i have gone to some discussions where the TA/IA give a great explainations to help us."
I enjoyed learning about the different graphs we can plot and how that information can help us learn more about the data we are working with. ,I dislike Jupyter Notebook as it often doesn't run properly and needing to restart the kernal often. This makes doing the assignment and labs difficult because I would code something correctly and it would fail multiple times but nothing is wrong. 
"I like that there is an incentive to make groups, because it helps me meet new people. I also like that we are using Python.",I feel like we jumped into seaborn and mathplot really fast and it has been a little difficult adjusting but otherwise it's going well.
The hands-on aspect,Glitches with Jupyter notebooks functionality
I've enjoyed the structure of it,I haven't enjoyed how finnicky assertions can be in some assignments
"I have enjoyed Professor Ellis' lectures because she has a funny personality. She makes learning in this class more engaging and interesting, and I appreciate her witty comments. She also is very open to discussion and questions, and encourages us to talk with others. She is patient and explains topics very well, as well as is very knowledgeable when answering our questions. ",What I've liked least about the class is the length of the discussion lab assignments. Some of them have taken more time to complete than the assignments themselves. 
I like that we have weekly practice problems to do in Datahub because it really helps me understand what we learn in class. I also like that we can attend any discussion which is more flexible for our schedules.,I’m only taking this class to fulfill my major requirement so if it wasn’t required I probably wouldn’t take it. 
"I never really understood the concept of data science and how connected it is to computer science. I have prior Python coding knowledge, but I never fully understood how data science works, so I would say that that is the thing I enjoyed most learning in COGS 108. I also like working on group projects just because it enhances my collaborative skills and makes doing the assignments a little easier, I guess.","I think one thing that annoyed me is the bugginess of JupyterLab. When I try validating my assignments on datahub it always crashes or lags for a long time, which shows how buggy my notebook is. That's the only thing that I really didn't like. "
I enjoyed learning how to use pandas. I really liked using the functions and seeing the visualizations appear when I run the code.,I don't really like using jupyter hub because of how it runs the code. Sometimes my code would be correct and it would give me an error and when I refresh the page a few times it would work.
I’ve enjoyed learning about the real life applications of data science and its ethical implications. ,I’ve least liked the moments of confusion I feel during lecture when concepts relating to applications to further analyze data; I think i would benefit from a more slow and simplified explanation as a newbie to data science. 
"I've enjoyed the assignments the most because I feel like I learn the most from doing them. Though they're quite challenging and time consuming at times, it's good practice and I feel like I'm making good use of my time and learning new skills and topics I didn't quite know before.",I think I like the group project the least. I feel a little unsure of how it should be approached or how I should work towards the project without holding my group back.
Just learning about coding is fun and challenging,It can get really confusing sometimes. Also we have to use extra time outside of class time for the group project.
I liked the previous project review as it gave me a lot of direction and an idea on how to approach the overall Final Project. ,"I think when it comes to assignments, I think when it comes to the assignments, it tends to get very laggy or glitchy when running the kernel, I know it's a client-side problem, but it is sometimes frustrating when I try running my notebook."
"Applications to research, especially regarding ethics! As someone in research, it’s always nice hearing how to prevent adverse effects resulting from publications.","Honestly, the class time haha - I know this is completely out of the control of the instructor but it does interfere with some of my other obligations."
I have enjoyed the interactive questions because of the extra credit and sometimes because I do learn content that is discussed in class. I also like that we get to be in groups for the final project. ,"I do not like how uncertain COGS 108 is. For example, the final project. I have no idea of the outcome or how it is to be all done because we learn one thing in class and then it's another thing. We switch from conceptual learning (i.e. clean and tidy data, ethics, and the 9 questions) then we go to actual coding. It has been confusing and overwhelming to say the least."
I enjoyed learning about the many aspects of data ethics and how it can have very negative impacts in the real world. I thought the inclusion of the real world examples mixed with listening to the lecture by DJ Patil gave me a deep understanding of the importance of not abusing your responsibilities. ,The thing that I liked least about cogs 108 is doing the labs and assignments because some of them tend to be tedious and have a lot of instructions to read and follow in a very specific manner. I understand how they are good for learning the basics of python but they can tend to be a bit too long in my opinion.
"The lectures! They use relevant examples to explain concepts to make class engaging. Also, the guest lectures provided a unique perspective on the data science field.","The assignments and discussions are often very different from what we learn in lecture. I know this was mentioned in class, but it still takes some research to be able to complete them (since I do not have a coding background)."
I have mostly enjoyed doing the assignments and discussions because I like how they make me think outside the box and they are also deepening my pandas knowledge which i enjoy.,The thing I have enjoyed the least about cogs 108 is honestly probably lecture since I am already familiar with the content that we have been covering for the past five weeks.
LEARNING A NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND VISUALIZING DATA,THE AMOUNT OF ASSIGNMENTS/TIME COMMITMENT PER WEEK
I have enjoyed lectures where we interact with jupyter notebooks,"I least enjoy working on discussion labs because in lab, we spend more time on group project than focusing on the lab."
I like the lectures and how they are interactive.,I feel like it required a lot more previous knowledge of coding than I thought.
We are working on Jupyter for homework and lab which is practicing a lot for coding skills.,I would like to tell that the guiding part of homework and labs are not clear enough to me.
"lectures because of things like the examples used, the way the professor lectures, and the engagement",wish there was more time for simple and small examples to practice using seaborn and matlab before a2/d3
"I think ive enjoyed the teaching style and work load, its a very ""make your bed and lie in it"" kind of class if you want to you can just watch lectures and do notebooks alone or you can be more hands on but at the end of the day it allows you to make your own bed so to speak.","I think probably my least favorite thing would be the speed at which collab is expected, around week 2 classes are barely getting settled and I do think it would be helpful to do some kind of survey or interest and try to pair people in the first two weeks off that to ensure groups are cohesive. The other thing is just way pandas and those things are taught however I dont think its specific to this class, the library is so expansive it basically always boils down to ""you know the use cases if you need syntax look at the documentation"" but I do recognize that the limiting factor is time. Very minor nit picks though overall am enjoying the class."
I enjoy completing the labs and assignments. The process of applying what we learned in class is the most enjoyable part for me. My favorite lectures are also the coding-based ones. I particularly liked the data wrangling lecture.,"I feel slightly frustrated by the instruction-related errors that occur in the coding assignments. I understand that mistakes happen, but I start to get confused when I have to keep track of the announcements in lecture or EdStem. The issues with A2 were particularly stressful. I also struggle to complete the labs sometimes when there haven't been as many examples in the lectures, but I understand that the purpose is to make us synthesize what we learned to form a concrete solution."
I've really like the content of the lecture once we started having lecture with the jupyter notebooks. I like learning more about visualizations and started to get more complex programming. Overall I really like the class structure and it makes planning my week a lot easier. ,"Nothing, I've had no issues with the class"
"What I have enjoyed most so far is the team collaboration, this class has allowed me to meet new people. ",Probably the assignments they are long and sometimes can be a little confusing. 
I've enjoyed the lectures. This is my second class with Professor Ellis and she is the only professor I commit full attendance to. ,Navigating working with my group has been a bit awkward because I don't know them very well and find that they may not want to meet in person. This has nothing to do with the class!
N/a,The quizes
I like learning about pandas because I think it’s interesting. I also like having a group to work with for the project because I feel like I have a community to reach out to when I’m stuck.,I do not like the data wrangling assignments because I feel like I do not have that much experience with Python so I feel like I’m struggling with it more.
I have enjoyed coming to lectures since they are engaging and not boring. I feel like I learn a lot from following along with the notebook and answering the google form questions. The course feels well organized and I can tell prof is prepared and cares about our learning.,"Overall I am pretty pleased with the class. I sometimes forget about the weekly quizzes, but that's on me. They're straightforward and relate to the material in a way that makes sense. "
I enjoyed meeting new people in my group project because it's difficult to get to know people in my classes aside from discussion sections and lecture. Our group has been very successful in meeting every week and have shared more informal contact information as well. ,"The thing I liked the least so far is how sometimes the lecture notes doesn't always align well with the lab assignments. However, this is still a fair system because this class isn't meant to be an introductory one. To make this easier I think I'm going to try to find a master list of things to use in python code. "
I like that this is a very project focused class as I have always wondered how to go about doing a data science project. I also like that we get to meet new people to do projects in this class.,"The thing I like least so far is that I feel like we are expected to do things in the discussion labs or assignments that I am not familiar with. But, this makes sense because this is not an introductory class and the issues are often fixed with a couple searches on google."
I enjoyed coming to lecture and learning all different aspects about data science.,"It takes a while to sit down and do the assignments and having to do a lecture quiz every week. The project also takes time to coordinate a time with group members, which was sometimes hard."
I have enjoyed the format of lectures and how the assignments reflect what we learn. I appreciate how clear it is when and what assignments are due each week. I also have been enjoying the topics in this course.,I have liked least figuring out each site we use to submit work and understanding where everything is on each site. I still feel unsure about git but I am getting more comfortable on Jupyter notebook.
So far I have enjoyed working with my group. Together we have created a good project proposal and have a good rhythm of working together. ,I have least liked the structure of the homeworks. 
Learning Pandas,Lecture is at 9am :(
I like the access to notes and professor makes lectures engaging,Wish all lecture material was covered before discussion lab is released so you can go to earlier section weekdays 
Seeing code create graphs ,Not being able to understand the long lines of coding
I've enjoyed the most in trying out the different codes (organizing & filtering graphs),I liked leaast about COGS 108 is the hidden tests that doesn't show and fail to get full points on the assignment.
"I have enjoyed familiarizing myself with csv., and the basics of coding.",I least enjoy coding especially working with data frames. I personally am not too confident in coding.
"I like that the pace of the class is digestible, the class doesn’t go too fast nor too slow. ","There isn’t anything that I have to complain about but maybe for better group building, it would be nice to have required a group assignment earlier in the quarter to  get comfortable with each other before starting work. "
I love the project aspect so far! It's fun to meet people and try to find a common question to answer.,I don't love the assignments honestly. They're difficult to debug and a lot of times I'll get an error and it'll fix itself after I restart the kernel. Then they'll reappear so I'm not sure if there really is an error or not.
SO FAR SO GOOD! I enjoyed working on the group project with my group mates because we are working as a team and everyone has a specialty in some areas.,"I love everything that this class has. If I have to pick one, I'd say is the new experiences with different platforms and coding language that I wasn't familiar with, which made me to step out my comfort zone haha. Overall, I appreciate it so much but I don't like it very much"
I enjoy how the workload is very manageable and the assignments and quizzes are reasonable as well. ,"I don't think this is directly tied to Cogs 108, but sometimes datahub/jupyter notebook doesn't work that well."
"I enjoyed working with my group mates on the project, discussing what we want to accomplish is fun.","I wish the class slides could be more specific on teaching us to code, though all of us have had basic python class before, the level of learning is quite different between individuals. "
I liked that all assignments are due on the same day every week which makes it consistent.,Like what I like most I also don't like that everything is due on the same day because it make it overwhelming that everything that week is all due on one day.
I like how the labs and assignments teach everything from the start rather than I assuming we know a lot beforehand. That I can work on them directly after lectures without feeling lost or needing to self-learn a lot through Google.,"The quizzes can sometimes have confusing questions that were not really covered in the lecture but rather a continuation of what we covered in the lecture. For example, if in a lecture, we covered a topic from A to E, the quiz would ask about something after E, meaning outside what we covered. That is expected, but sometimes I can argue that multiple answers (or both answers if T/F question) are correct. In that case, I cannot go back to the lecture because we did not cover this.
Also, I think for one of the quizzes, we were asked about something we still had not covered in class yet, as we ran out of time, so we left it for next week, but the quiz still had a question about it. I think that happened in quiz 3, where we were asked about privacy when we had not yet covered it in the lecture."
Professor Ellis's enthusiasm and excitement to share her knowledge in class. It makes the material much more interesting and feel like it's worth learning.,"The D3 assignment was honestly quite difficult. I had to ask for a lot of help and even when the TA's gave me a glimpse of their code I had no idea what they were doing, what things meant, how I would even begin to try and complete that myself. I think it's because our lectures had nothing to do with data viz so it was mostly figure it out yourself. Also, some of the questions were not worded very clearly so it was not explicit what kind of graph/output the question was asking for."
"I've enjoyed data visualization most so far, I think partially since it was really fun getting to learn a new Python library and the different formats that took. I also thought it was cool actually making our own graphs and plots, especially going from just a few lines of code to a visualization that would take quite a bit of time to hand-draw/things along that line.","I think my least favorite part about COGS 108 so far has been version control, just since it was a new concept for me and I found it a bit confusing/stressful to implement since I was worried I'd mess something up more permanently compared to just messing up a section of code. However, I think Github Desktop has been really helpful in helping me understand this section of lecture."
"I have liked the step by step homework. I am not the best coder there is, so the step by step has really helped me understand what to do and what not to do. It has also helped my coding abilities","I have not liked the non step by step homework, more specifically D4. I got a bit lost, and had somewhat of a hard time doing the coding."
"Getting familiar with packages in python (pandas, seaborne, etc)","9am class time, I go to bed too late"
I think the coding skills such as the pandas and numpy libraries are pretty useful especially for future work. These skills can be generalized beyond the scope of class. I can use it in lab and work.,"I think the organization of the class is a little overwhelming because there are so much work to remember. Although the workload of each work may not be so heavy, all the workload splits into different tasks make me hard to track them. Sometimes, it is easy to omit some task and lose that point."
I enjoy being able to understand what data science is and being able to practice by using it in the assignments and discussion labs. I also enjoy getting to do hands on data visualization with real data. ,"For me, some of the discussion labs are a bit hard due to the depth of python programming those assignments assume I have but don't. "
"I've enjoyed the format of the class, especially that we are given projects and assignments instead of in person tests which allows for a self-directed educational experience.",The course doesn't explain python syntax or support for people less experienced in coding which I understand. 
"I like how there is a big project as the main assignment for the course. I think it is a lot more useful than taking a midterm and final and likely forgetting most of the information after the tests. Doing a project seems more interactive and helpful, especially if we include it on our resumes. ",I don't have any complaints about COGS 108.
"How organized and engaging the class is. I like how clearly the assignments and deadlines are structured. Professor Ellis also makes attending in-person more fun by making the lectures more interactive, encouraging participation, and connecting the material to real life examples. ",The amount of students feels a little overwhelming and makes me feel invisible. But I resolve this by coming to class early and sitting in the front row. 
I would say the project planning and journey in trying to make a nice project that fun for me and the rest of my group. ,I guess the lack of depth. We don’t go much into detail about things. But it’s 10 weeks and we wanna cover a lot so it makes sense.
I have most enjoyed starting to work on the projects as I am able to to use my data science skills on a fascinating project.,I have not particularly enjoyed some of the assignments because there have been issues with some of the assert tests.
I have really enjoyed the assignments on datahub because they have made sure that I am applying what I have learned.,"I have least liked the lectures through slides, I enjoy the lectures that are on datahub much more because it allows us to see live application of what we are learning."
"The detail that you go through in lecture really helps, and I really like that when a student asks a question during lecture you make sure the whole class understands what is being asked and also the answer that you provide. Lab assignments really help prepare and understand the regular assignments.",Assignments are a bit stressful just because I want a good grade and they are worth a lot more than the lab assignments.
I think my favorite things so far has been the 7 free late days because it alleviates stress,"I think so far, one of the things I would change is making discussion section more helpful in regards to the assignments, like a brief walk through the D assignments."
I like the collaboration aspect of the class. I like the new people I met. ,Sometimes the datahub assignments can get annoying. The test cases are sort of strict. 
"Working on the final project with the team, since there is a nice team collaboration experience going on right now. People are contributing all together and putting this final project together. ","The first assignment, instructions about the github portion was not well and I missing that part of the grade even with the github repos. "
"The interactiveness of the class, such as discussions with class mates about poll questions.",It's hard to find a time where all 5 people in the group are available to meet.
"I find the coding assignments and labs easy to understand, granted I have previous coding experience.","The project seems so overwhelming and so much work, despite us not even starting really yet."
Learning about Python libraries like Pandas and Numpy,The weekly labs are lengthy 
The labs because it is easy to see if you did them correctly or not.,The lecture quizzes because sometimes it is subjective.
I've enjoyed working with my group. They have been helpful and we all work together well. ,I thought the assignments are really long and I procrastinate finishing it. I'd rather have assignments more often but less to do for each one. 
The thing that I've enjoyed most about Cogs 108 is learning more about data science as I had now prior experience in it.,The thing I've enjoyed is that sometimes they are hard topics to grasp.
I like that the project is the main component of this class instead of exams. I also like that the project can be something we can add to our resumes,"There's nothing that comes to my mind, I think everything in the course is designed very well"
how to manage data,labs
I really enjoyed doing the labs. I like how they provided step by step instructions and guide to each topic. It was completely easy to understand and I really liked this format or learning.,"Currently, I mostly like everything in this class. However, there was one assignment that I particularly disliked. That assignment was reviewing past COGS 108 final projects. Although I liked the idea and thought behind it, I do not think it was effective in what the assignment wanted to achieve. The questions that we had to answer for the project we reviewed were challenging to answer because I didn't really know how to answer them. I didn't know if the projects were good or bad. I didn't know if the code was good or bad. I didn't know if the visualizations for the machine learning part were good or bad. There was a lot of content within the projects that was unfamiliar, so it was hard to pinpoint what was effective within the project and what wasn't. I kind of had to just go off of the feeling or vibes I got from the project. I think the only thing I found helpful were the introductions and background at the start of those projects because they helped me understand what a project should look like."
The collaborative chatting tie during class where we discuss answers to questions ,-
We have labs and assignments to practice coding and skills we need in preparation for the project. ,"The labs and assignments aren't hard, but there's dues each week which makes me somehow feel stressed when it comes to exam week."
"I have enjoyed the participation and class talk the most in COGS 108 because it allows me to put to practice what I learn, instead of just listening to lecture. I like learning through practice, so listening alone makes me forget easily.","There is nothing particular that I dislike about COGS 108. Everything is perfectly fine to me so far, but if there is one thing I have to pick, sometimes the professor talks too fast. I sometimes get lost if we speed run through one slide, especially if that topic is new to me."
I like how we get to discuss with other people during lecture,"I wish we had more review over the coding parts, it's a bit confusing to figure out homework sometimes"
Working together in a group and learning how to develop in a team using Github,"There are too many assignments and it gets confusing to remember. The content isn't hard or time-consuming, but it's just hard to track all the different types of assignments. I would rather have one or maybe two a week that are longer so it is not confusing"
I enjoy the active learning aspect of lectures. I'm unfortunately very familiar with lectures that lose my attention very easily and don't have a lot of active learning. ,"My least favorite part of COGS 108 so far was the difficulty that D3 was, but I'm not blaming anyone for this besides perhaps myself... I didn't go to section. I was trying to do it by myself at home, and the lecture notes had some good examples here and there."
Interesting material? I don't have much experience with data science so I think it's interesting to learn all the different ways of gathering and organizing data.,I wish there was a more in-depth tutorial for pandas and the different types of things you can do with it.
I like that the notebooks and assignments are straightforward and easy to follow along. ,I feel like the labs could be a bit more detailed in regards to syntax/what is looked for in the code in the instructions.
"Yes, I learn a lot on how to propose interesting data science question, consider about ethic and stakeholders and coding",cannot think of any
Learing about how to visualize the data.,"There's not a particular thing that I don't like, but if would be better if the font size of the code could be bigger when projected on the screen because sometimes it's a little hard to see what's being modified on the code."
I enjoy the lectures because they make the material easier to understand and I enjoy the participation stuff. It's actually interesting and I learn a lot from it.,Probably the D3 lab assignment just because it took me awhile to get it and I spent hours on it trying to figure it out.
I've enjoyed how it explains the practical application of what we're doing.,Sometimes the discussion assignments feel a little repetitive.
The flow of the class,I feel more practical examples would help in better understanding the comcept
Lectures,Assignment 1
I've enjoyed getting more hands on experience coding. Completing the labs and the assignments are making me feel more confident in my data science skills. ,I am not a big fan of group projects and I think especially ones where the project is largely in our hands. It will be an academic challenge that I'm not accustomed to but I also know that the final product will be very rewarding. 
lectures are fun and informative,nothing really 
I think the Labs in this course is pretty useful ,nothing 
Practicality. I like how I can immediately see the results of my actions through code presented in data science applications such as jupyter notebooks.,"Bugs with jupyter notebook assignments that make me nervous when submitting. The submission process is quite more complicated compared to other submission processes; for example the assignment must be fetched and manually submitted, and even then are some of the validation does not work at times."
"I have enjoyed learning about coding in a simple, effective way. The class takes everything at a time, it is not overwhelming. ",I am a litlle scared about the final project.
The opportunity to learn very valuable tools like numpy and python. ,Misalignment between lectures and assignments. Which is okay but just causes some confusion sometimes. 
The Labs were very helpful in providing opportunities to practice technical techniques covered in class and prepare for the assignments.,"The group project, but this is solely due to personal preference. I usually choose to work alone when the option is available, this is solely due to personal preference."
I've enjoyed learning about the real-world applications of data science.,Nothing
I’ve enjoyed the process of developing a project proposal and learning about the different data science methods we can apply. It’s exciting to think about how we’ll use these tools in our future projects.,Deciding on a data science question and being able to find the ideal dataset seemed like a tiring and tedious process.
"Probably learning about data visualization and git, feels like stuff that I will use again and again in future classes, personal projects, or in a work environment.","For one week, I did the discussion before the assignment and I felt like the assignment kind of taught you how to do the things for the discussion lab and didn't realize that. "
I like working with Pandas and the datasets,I have not enjoyed trying to figure out the graphs in the Labs and the autograder
I most enjoyed being able to go to discussions whenever I need extra help on my discussion labs. It makes it easier for students who don't like going one-on-one with TA's during office hours to get aid. ,"The thing I liked least about COGS 108 so far is that the weekly quizzes are single attempt. I think it would be more informative if it allowed multiple attempts, while also having some relevant multiple-choice coding questions."
The flexibility is amazing ,the clearness about the instructions 
Being able to work in groups and having a very open ended final project,The discussion hw and assignments because it's mostly stuff I have done before
"I think that the labs and assignments have generally be interesting to work on. Given that I only took COGS18 as my previous experience with python, I think that the labs especially have been a nice refresher and has allowed me to explore some new concepts that I hadn't known about before. Beyond a few hiccups of being lost on what tools are available to me for a few tasks, conceptually I am doing pretty well at understanding everything.","I think that the group project is extremely intimidating. The project task itself seems very extensive in what I would need to do to accomplish it but also having to work on it with 4 other people of which some seem to have a different perspective about the quality of work to strive for, it is a bit stressful just thinking about how my future timeline is going to look."
Applying python is more practical setting. Not too familiar with python before this class but it's fun getting the hang of it and actually learning about data science.,"What I've liked the least so far is the extra credit. I know it's extra and professors don't need to do it and I'm thankful there is extra credit at all, but the opportunity to do and earn more would be nice."
"The class feels very interactive and engaging, I especially like how Prof. Ellis integrates the attendance questions with lecture content (ie. using the estimation activity as data to clean and analyze later down the line).","Felt like I always have to look up and double check documentation for pandas/seaborn, but maybe all the functions haven't sunk in yet. The lectures going through the notebooks are quick and tend to gloss over a lot of details but overall I think that's fine, I probably just need more practice with pandas."
"I have enjoyed learning about Seaborn the most. I feel it very fun to try and come up with interesting plots and visualize the data. Once you can see trends, it makes it easy to find answers to problems that arise.","The large amounts of work, I feel very overwhelmed. There is a lot of content, some of which I have done, other is new. I feel like the class moves very quickly."
"I liked learning about how to use different plotting libraries in Python. I had previously only used matplotlib to make plots, so getting additional exposure with seaborn helped me understand how to easily make visualizations like countplots.","I thought that the instructions in some of the assignments and discussions have been a little bit unclear, and some of the loading in data cells take a rather long time to load. But, my questions have always been quickly answered in EdStem which I appreciate."
I really enjoy how open ended the project can be. It gives me something I can show off on my resume which is great. I also loved the guest lectures. I learned a lot of career advice from watching the spotify guest lecture. ,"I have least enjoyed the discussion and assignments. This is because I find a lot of the questions to be ambiguous. I'm often left wondering what the question wants me to do, and I end up having to reverse engineer the solution from the assert statements. In my opinion, I should not have to do this if the question is clear enough in what it wants me to return/do. 
Also, DataHub is very difficult to work with at times, as I've had trouble validating, saving notebooks, and submitting assignments. In my opinion, the assignments should be on GitHub so that students both can use the git clone and git pull commands they learned, while having the files locally to avoid the current conflicts that I face with DataHub."
"the lectures, i feel that they are very engaging and interesting","the homework, i feel that i struggle a bit with the hw especially the discussion ones and often times get confused on what the error is"
The assignments/discussions. As a bioengineering major I don’t have much experience with python. The assignments are fun as they allow me to sequentially build my knowledge of python and investigate how to code through actual practice.,The majority of my classes are Tuesday and Thursday and 1 hour 20 minutes. I think having longer lectures would better suit the class as often topics are spanning multiple lectures. In the second day of the topic I often have to catch myself up on what was done last lecture
I've enjoyed learning about the ways in which data can become biased simply by surrounding environments or just inherently in the way it was collected. ,"I dislike how little guidance there is for some of the coding, especially coming in without any prior python knowledge. It would help a bit more to go over more of the unique syntax and general functions of the code in class more often. "
I enjoy that the curriculum is very comprehensive and covers a broad scope and touches lightly on many different essential topics / skills rather than tunnel visioning on one. ,"The assignments and discussions are very poorly made. There are often typos and spelling errors. On more complex problems, there should be examples on what the input should look like"
I really enjoyed the high level overview of data science and the pace of the class. As a data science major this material is familiar to me but I am not getting bored with the content.,No complaints!
The project based style of the course where we are able to collaborate on a project with a team similar to the what would happen in the workforce was my favorite because it's the most applicable.,"Sometimes, the weekly quizzes would ask questions that the professor didn't cover yet and it was in the lecture she gave after she came back from her trip."
I enjoyed learning about data science principles and how we should be conducting projects. I find the material to be really useful. ,"Sometimes, the instructions for the assignments and labs don’t give enough information. For example, for D3, we weren’t told that one of the graphs was supposed to be a grouped barplot instead of a stacked proportion graph like we were taught in lecture. I only figured this out when I went to discussion to ask about a different question."
I like how Professor Ellis teaches; she is great at explaining concepts.,I don't like how the weekly assignments and labs feel like busy work. There just feels like a lot to do but maybe that is just the quarter system
Learning about data science and the way the course is structured.,The datahub glitches.
"I have enjoyed the lectures, they are pretty informative and Professor Ellis is highly knowledgeable and an enthusiastic educator. ","I don't enjoy how python heavy the course is, it's definitely a steep learning curve for those that are not too familiar with python so the assignment and discussion lab can be pretty daunting and harsh. "
"What I have enjoyed most about COGS108 is how simple the flow of the class structure is. I understand what needs to be completed every week and I am given the resources available to do so, as in the information is in the lecture.","What I have liked least about COGS 108 so far is how difficult some times the assignment becomes. What I mean by this is that, sometimes when I am doing an assignment I am stuck on one part for a very long time and un able to correctly match the assertion values. Yes, I do look at online resources to look up syntax, however sometimes I am unable to get the correct values which leads to frustration. I suggest teaching more syntax that is applicable in the assignments and labs."
Professors Ellies teaching ,nothing in particular 
I enjoy working with a group as it makes the whole class feel a bit less overwhelming,I'm not used to coding so sometimes the labs and assignments are very challenging especially because it feels like we haven't really learned many parts of it in class. However I've really only taken cogs 18 which was very straight forward in terms of what we learned in class was exactly what was on the labs so I know it supposed to be a bit more challenging in this class
the lectures! i feel like they're super interesting and interactive,using jupyterhub - i know its super convenient but in my experience it's been really buggy and half the time my environment is messed up and my code won't run :(
I most enjoyed the lecture style of Professor Ellis. It made going to lectures more enjoyable.,I least liked D3 because it personally felt like the most confusing assignment we have had so far.
"I like that everything is explained in the most basic level, just to clear everyones basic root concepts",I think the homeworks are a little too easy... I start them the day it is due and can finish them really quickly... some more challenging ML assignments would be more fun
Professor Ellis is one of the best lecturers,"Assignments are all due Sunday, a weekday would have been preferable but I'm super happy that they are all due on the same day so I don't have to think about what is due when."
the assignments have been engaging and good to develop my skills,some of the stuff to organize with my group has been tricky but thats mostly canvas
"- lecture topics: I love how they always teach new and interesting things, even when it's not directly useful formulas or coding methods like most other data science classes. I really loved the parts on Fermi estimation, the Simpson paradox, and the asynchronous lecture of choosing to watch a pre-recorded lecture from a guest
- reasonable assignment deadlines and workload",none
I have enjoyed how the lectures include the students especially when the teacher uses our answers as data to show as an example.,"I just wish that the coding was shown a bit more because as someone who took CSE 11 I know very little about pandas as I started with java. The concepts aren't too hard, but it just feels like I am behind when it comes to coding."
Group project and assignments are the things I enjoyed most. Cause I never taken a class with group projects before. This is a challenge but also an interesting thing for me.,The feedback for assignments and quizzes are a little bit slow. But anything else I feel good with this course.
"I have enjoyed learning more about. Python. Also, this is my first time using jupyterlab and it has been my favorite coding platform to use so far!","The material can get confusing at some points, and if I don't pay attention in class for a little while I feel as if I fall behind pretty quickly."
I've enjoyed the real-life application examples of the class. ,"I kinda wish the assignments didn't have hidden tests, but I understand why they do. "
"I like doing the homeworks. I think I just enjoy solving problems in general, and writing codes feel like a fun problem solving activity.","Mostly the in-person lectures, but only because 2pm is not a good time for me and I can't go to the 9am one. So, the lectures when I go in-person haven't really helped me a lot just entirely because I'm mentally gone at around that time. But watching the podcasts are helpful."
"I appreciate that this class is project-based rather than test-focused. It gives me hands-on experience, especially when working in a group and collaborating on ideas. It highlights the importance of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, showing how discussions and meetings can lead to effective solutions.","COGS 108 has been one of the most challenging classes I’ve taken since I’m not a professional coder and have only an introductory level of coding experience. My biggest struggle with the course is that, despite putting in my best effort, I often encounter errors in assignments and discussions. When I submit my work (knowing that there are errors) I receive low scores without the opportunity to improve after submission. The grading focuses on correctness rather than completion or learning from mistakes, which I understand, but it can be discouraging. I try to attend office hours for help, but my class and work schedule sometimes make it difficult—though I recognize that this isn't the course’s fault."
The lecture. I really enjoy the way Prof Ellis explains things and her enthusiasm towards it. ,Jupyternotebook not being explained well enough. Perhaps it's because I haven't been going to all the discussion sessions. 
"I enjoy the extra practice we get manipulating dataframes, since it is very applicable to one of the other course I am taking this quarter.",Lecture is early in the morning
The assignments because they are very detailed and straightforward.,Nothing as of now.
I have enjoyed learning about the scope of data science and the possibilities data analysis can unlock and the variety of questions it can answer,This is my first upper-division class with coding in it and I have never taken a class in Python. I am not used to learning a lot of the coding on my own but this is something I can get used to. 
"I enjoyed learning a bit of every thing about data science application like pandas and plt and sns, etc. I also like the overall pace of the course.",It's more a project thing than a cogs108 course thing but finding great datasets for a good question is so hard :')
I've enjoyed collaborating with my group and generating ideas for our project. ,My least favorite component has been having to write code for graphs. 
"I don't fall asleep, that's a good sign! Everything is very well and clearly communicated.","So far so good, the labs are kind of slow but nothing too bad."
I’ve mostly enjoyed learning how to use pandas to my advantage to visualize and clean data. Even though it was kind of difficult it’s enjoyable.,"I don’t think there was anything in specific, just definitely took me some time to get accustomed to using pandas but it’s also because I’ve never used it."
Engaging lectures and largely intuitive assignments,"Nitpick- Difficulty of D4, a bit unguided assignments at times"
Getting hands on experience and learning from it.,The coding and how tedious it is. 
I really enjoy the fact that we have live code and I can see what each function does and the graphs it outputs.,"I don't have any complaints so far, I have really enjoyed the class!"
"I have enjoyed the lectures being interactive. For example, the think-pair-share and questions wider concepts such as the Fermi estimation. ","I have least liked the lectures that did not correspond to the assignments/discussion labs timing-wise. My prior experience in coding is COGS 18, and so far this has been a big step in coding for me. I am trying my best to understand, but it is harder than I expected."
Being able to apply data science to real-world scenarios. The topics we learned so far were really interesting and I enjoyed working with PANDAS and seaborn.,"The assignments can be somewhat tedious, but the workload is manageable so far. "
Learning more about pandas in python,N/A
"I really enjoyed how the topic of ethics in data science was covered fairly early in this class. When applying for college, I wanted to study Cognitive Science, mainly because of the many ethical dilemmas involved with the subject, especially in regards to data collection and social media algorithms. The ethics lectures was a great reminder for me of why I wanted to study CogSci at UCSD in the first place. ","The hardest part of COGS 108 so far has been some of the assignments, that have had either confusing or too-vague instructions, and the TAs have not always been helpful on how to debug my code. In particular, the most recent D4 lab was a little confusing, as there were a few times where I did not understand what the instructions were asking of me. However, the assignments and labs have been very helpful in gaining good practice on coding with Python, Pandas, and Seaborn, and it has been fun to get back into coding when I have not coded for so long."
"I enjoy how the lectures are really organized and the professor is well spoken, which makes it easy to follow along. Last quarter when I took COGS 18, the professor was a little hard to understand and the lectures would be scrambled, so I really appreciate the lectures that I have now.","What I like least about COGS 108 are the assignments. Some of the assignments would take me hours or days to do compared to the assignments I had in COGS 18. This is not the professors fault, its mainly due to my slow understanding of python and the course's rigor."
I like the parts were Professor Ellis codes directly in JupyterLab and then runs it so I get a direct visual understanding of how the code works and what it does.,The part I like least about this class is pacing. I would like there to be more in-depth coverage of what the code does exactly because sometimes it's confusing and hard to remember right away.
I really like the interactive lectures and the assignments also are a comprehensive review of everything that weve learned so far. ,Nothing really I like the pace and content
The in-class participation/think pair share activities and the wisdom of the crowds where we get to apply what we are learning and talk through our ideas with our classmates.,"Having to look up pandas syntax and functions in order to do what is being asked of me in the weekly lab assignments, since there isn't always a hint or direction about what to use to accomplish a certain task so I have to use trial and error."
"I enjoy going to lecture so far. They are easy to follow, engaging, and interesting to learn.",The assignments are pretty difficult to do alone. I usually need to collaborate with a friend to complete them on time but it isn't something that I should complain or worry too much about.
I like how the slideshows are organized are well on the github.,I think the least think I like about cogs 18 is how there are so many assignments.
"Discussion assignments, as they are thorough and easy enough for me to get a grasp of the coding application of what we learned in class throughout the week. It feels more like a hand-holding assignment which prepares me well for the actual assignment","Nothing in particular in terms of content, maybe I could say that I struggle to fit in with a group when it comes to doing large application projects with a team, though I know this is important for the real-world and is a good aspect of the course, it is more of a personal thing for me "
The process of choosing project topics.,Labs :(
I enjoyed the easy structure of what to do and when to do assignments as well as the availability of accessing lectures and notes.,I'd like to see the concepts we learned in class to still be retaught/referenced again in our assignments rather than just problem sets.
I've enjoyed the lectures and learning about different aspects of data science.,Nothing.
"I enjoy the hand on aspect of this course. The assignments so far are approachable and good learning experiences, and are very relevant to the content you go over during lecture. love how we are doing a collaborative project instead of an exam","The difficulty of the discussions lab. I wish tas were more willing to help you through the problems instead of pointing towards some vague lesson in lecture. More often then not, I am present in discussion, because I can't understand the lecture, and I wish discussions aided in answering questions more directly. "
"I like the discussions and assignments because it gives me an opportunity to do hands on coding, which is something that is really lacking in my ICAM classes but that I want a lot more experience with. I also like my discussion section because it's a chance for my TA to answer my coding questions (kinda like office hours time which is really helpful)","The actual project part so far has been kind of difficult for me (like writing up the project proposal). I guess I just don't feel prepared, but I might not have as much background in data science as some other people in the class so that could be making it more difficult?"
I've enjoyed working with data visualization in COGS 108. I liked transforming raw data into something that is more meaningful to look at. This allows me to present data that may look difficult to understand into something more visually pleasing.,"I found the Jupyter Notebook environment to be unreliable. I thought it was really slow and had frequent kernel issues, like getting stuck during restarts or the validation took not working correctly, so I had to exit out and try again."
"Labs and Assignments, which are easy to follow and focus on understanding the fundamentals and the tools to work with data projects.",n/a
I have liked the idea of freedom with the group projects. The assignments we do give us great practice with what we need.,I feel like the discussion assignments are very similar to the assignments.
I liked the group formation and the early project assignments. This feels like a good way to actually apply the skills we learn to a topic we are interested in; it increases motivation to learn.,"Some of the syntax for pandas and seaborn is really unintuitive and took me a while to learn, and learning it was unsatisfying in the process. "
The hands on homework and the learn by doing aspect of the class.,I feel like the lectures could include more resources for the coding parts as most of the coding feels like self taught learning for myself at least.
It is structured very well. I think the assignments and discussions on datahub are good at teaching practical skills and foundational knowledge. They're not too easy to the point where I don't improve and they're not too hard to the point where I learn nothing because I have no idea what to do. The expectations of the course are well-communicated too.,Reviewing graded work. I wish there were example answers on jupyter after grades are released rather than just scores.
"I enjoyed the lectures, the way the professor teaches and shows both the pdf slides as well as in jupyter.","I haven't particularly found the discussions very helpful, I think some of them are like you do your own work there and if you need help, ask. Kind of like office hours- "
"I have enjoyed the lectures the most. I think the lectures are engaging and interesting. For instance, by demonstrating certain data science concepts real-time through the Google Form surveys. Furthermore, the Jupyter notebooks keep things hands on, and there is a good balance between informative slides and practical ones.","I think the discussions have been a little bit lacking in content. This was based on my experience in the first discussion, because after that I did not really go because I assumed it was just extra office hours like the first discussion."
I love how we are able to interact more with one another in the class through the project. ,"It's not too bad, the workload and everything, but one thing would be that we do move at a relatively quick pace especially the pandas lecture and seaborn, but the homework and discussion helps. "
I love how it is encouraged that we engage with the teacher assistants.,I don't have any complaints. 
I have enjoyed getting to explore the platform of Jupyter Notebook and Github. I have never coded in this format and find it helpful to work with in comparison to my prior experience with PAs.,Sometimes going back and forth between discussing technical/practical applications of python and discussing theoretical/conceptual ideas of data science can get confusing and make the flow of the course a little disorienting.
I enjoyed the study of github. I've used github before but was not quite familiar with it and had many issues when collaborating with others. Now I am much clear on how to use it.,no
I really appreciate the organization of the course. It is pretty clear where to find things. I know when assignments are due. It is clear what week the notes are part of. ,"I think the speed it somewhat difficult, but I know that is just the way of the quarter system. I wish there was more detail on some of the more complex topics, but that would require another class."
I’ve liked the interactive aspect of our data being used in following classes. It makes things more personal and engaging when we’re among the data being measured.,"I think pacing wise sometime around week 3/4 we lost track of ours in alignment with our assignments which was made things a little confusing. The guest lectures were for important reasons, I think I mean more when we resumed lecturing with Professor Ellis it took a little to find our footing again."
To be quite honest. Not much. ,"I’ve already learned essentially the same material in COGS9. The assignments feel like they were made in a rush, with many typos and poor autograders. I wish the group project started earlier, because now I feel like my group has to cram for the next 5 weeks to get this whole project done. I wish the class focused more on the collaboration, My group has only met once and it’s week 5? We are all busy, so cramming this project in the next couple weeks is going to be difficult. It would be a lot easier if the proposal was due week 3 or something."
The freedom of picking a project and working collaboratively as a team.,Nothing :)
The flexibility of the class and how there is 7 late passes because I need them with all the issues I have been going through,"The due dates that are all on sunday, I like if it was due on Friday's. However, I don't really have a struggle with this."
I’ve enjoyed how COGS 108 combines practical coding skills with real-world data analysis challenges. Working on projects that require critical thinking and teamwork has been especially rewarding.,"The most challenging part of COGS 108 has been the steep learning curve for certain tools or datahub probelms, especially when documentation isn't straightforward. It can feel overwhelming at times to balance debugging with meeting project deadlines."
"Probably the sections/labs, I got to meet a new group of people and not only does that allow me to have help on any work, but also a genuine new group of people to talk to.","Probably some of the length of the assignments, I feel like after I complete one part, there's much more to do after."
"So far, I enjoy the assignments and real-world data analysis although it is challenging it has made me become incredibly engaged with the content and course itself. ",I have found the heavy workload and challenging coordination in group projects can be demanding. I also personally do not like that assignments and labs are assigned at the same time but I do understand that the course is structured in a certain way. 
"The use of one the most important libraries in Python, Pandas.",I do not like Jupiter Notebooks. It takes way to long to load assignments and the delay is horrible.
I have enjoyed the quizzes as I feel they are practical and good checkpoints for our understanding.,I have not enjoyed having both an assignment and discussion lab I feel like in the long run one of them should be reconsidered or combined in one because it feels a little overwhelming to have three assignments or more due every week. 
I've enjoyed learning pandas basics.,Trying to get the group project moving when a lot of the members have exams from other classes has been kind of hard.
I enjoy the problem solving aspect of the class. It is always so satisfying to run code and not see any red underneath!,"I found it a little out of my comfort zone to find a group in a class that I didn't know anybody. I would say it was a good experience though. And similarly, the 9 am lecture is a little early for me, but I also appreciate getting my day started earlier and have been really good about attending lecture and adjusting my schedule. I have had early classes in the past, but haven't been as good about regularly attending."
"I enjoyed using pandas and coding overall in python, and the group work at times. My favorite part is learning how to use pandas and applying it to the project.","My group hasn't been very active on the chat except for one person, so the problem I'd say with COGS 108 is when choosing partners. Overall, it's a great class, but the thing is that when choosing your group, it can be tough to work with people who don't incorporate themselves."
"What I enjoy the most about cogs 108 so far is creating different types of plots, gives more creativity","what I least like about Cogs 108 is sometimes the use of data hub. This is a personal opinion based on my experiences so far but every time I need to run the cells or compile them the website takes forever to load, sometimes not even loading. I would have to refresh multiple times to have the cells run and its quite a hassle."
"The lectures, help me learned about data and data analyzing in a really fun way.","I would say discussions and assignments are sometime a little time consuming, but overall nothing I really dislike."
The quality lectures,The ambivalent test cases from the last lab that was a time sink for me (I did appreciate that it was addressed and cleared up)
"Working with a team, I just love a collaborative setting.",The lack of canvas utilization. There're too many links located densely in the home page and it can be frustrating to go through at times.
"I like how the workload is manageable. I'm taking a lot of project-based classes this quarter, so I'm often on the brink of burnout...",Coming up with a good project proposal. It's hard to find a topic that doesn't have too large of a scope and it feasible. It's also hard to find public data sets on topics I am interested in such as specific video games content.
I have enjoyed learning about the data science process and the step by step process on how to tackle a potential data science question.,"So far, I don't like the portions outside of coding like the analysis and communication parts."
I enjoy the openness of the projects and how we can choose whatever topic what we want or are interested in to perform data analysis on. ,"Sometimes, the assignment question prompts are worded confusingly/not clearly which makes it hard to know exactly what we are supposed to do, not sure if this is just a misunderstanding on my end though. "
I love the format and pace of this class. I feel that I am able to engage with the material in a meaningful way without being overwhelmed.,"The one person in my group project group who has commandeered the project and completely taken it in a different direction by being pushy and not giving anyone else a chance to think and have a say for themselves, or ask others what they would like to do with the project, or give a democratic vote to the direction we take."
"how easy to follow along the lectures are. they're pretty descriptive, but not too where youre feeling overwhelmed. i've honestly stopped attending lectures, because the slides and podcasts are very easy to follow.","the group project aspect. i feel that no matter what group youre in, there will be 1 to 2 people in your group that give little to no effort, suck at communicating, etc."
Learning about stats and pandas,"I like it overall, but it is sometimes hard to understand the content (pandas) because I'm new to those and a transfer/international student. "
I actually really enjoy the lectures and the content. A lot of it is topics I've learned in previous classes but it was nice to get a refresher and I still enjoy coding and data science. I also like the fact that Google Forms are regularly used to involve the class.,"I'm generally fine with how the course is run overall. If I had to pick something I like the least, I guess I would say it is the weekly quizzes we have. It feels a little unnecessary for me since I regularly attend lecture and am committed to actually learning everything."
"I have enjoyed learning more about python as I aim to grow my skills and become more proficient in the coding language, as well as gain an understanding of using it in data science, which is new to me. I have also liked meeting my team and collaborating on what we liked and didn't like from previous projects so that we could potentially incorporate ideas from them that we found interesting. ","I feel like the homework is slightly challenging which is good and the pacing of learning new content is manageable, although sometimes the work load for some weeks can be a lot more than others. This allows me to practice time management to be able to finish everything on time."
"For the project part, we have the opportunity to review previous work and discuss with our group mates, which is interesting and great.","""I don't like the lab work and the assignments because the tests are not really useful. I don't think we really need the lab session with the test, and I don't think the lab should be doing that. I believe we should have the chance to test the code by ourselves, and the test should only serve as a reference."
Learning about pandas and how to extract data from datasets: specifically about cleaning and organizing data because that’s useful for my research. ,Lots of assignments that I have to keep track of every week - they all have the same deadline but it feels like more pressure because there’s something due every week. 
"I really have enjoyed the lecturing style of the professor and I like the datahub. It makes it nice that there is an area where all of the lecture, discussion, and assignment material is which helps me stay organized in this course.",I personally haven't enjoyed how much python has been covered but that is because for me I have already done most of this so it's review that isn't super useful yet. I understand though that I am not the majority so I don't see this as an issue it's just what I enjoy the least.
"Learning about Pandas, and other libraries ","Learning about Pandas, and other libraries "
"The project based class, I wanted to get more experience with Github and Git in general so I believe that the class has provided me with a 'foot in the door'.","One thing I liked lesat about the class was the group making, I tried making groups and messaging people only to find out that they didn't choose me to be in the group and I had to find out myself through messaging them. Now I'm in a group that I didn't choose and I'm just going with the flow."
"i like being able to work on our own project, applying the skills i have gained from other classes in a creative and interesting way","i'm not really into all the python review for the class. it feels like a lot of busy work and not the best use of time in the class, especially considering a lot of other classes go into depth. we're only spending like half of the quarter/class actually working on the class, when it is a project based class? i think it would be better to be able to spend more on the actual project"
The virtual guest lecture day! It was great to hear about someone's experience in the real world.,The pace of the lectures (too slow).
"So far in COGS 108, I have most enjoyed getting to practice using python and learn how to work with data.","So far in COGS 108, I have least enjoyed coordinating group meeting times."
I enjoy how informational the lectures are,Some assignments and labs just because its hard to determine the correct answer since typically coding has to be exact.
Ive enjoyed learning how to create various graphs on datahub as it is something that i didn't get to learn in depth in COGS 18,Completing assignments that required searching up codes that we haven't learned in lecture was the part I dislike about COGS 108. It always have me questioning if my code is correct or if it is executing what the question asked for even after it passes the assert tests.
The group project,nothing 
I enjoy working through the discussion labs,"I'm finding the group assignment difficult because my group is very disorganized, but I think we are working on getting more organized now that we are starting to work on the project. "
I think I enjoy the in class live data collection.,The assignments are pretty challenging and confusing at times when the notes don’t align.
Collaborating with others to build a project because this gives real life practice and gives realistic expectations when working in a team for a company.,The past of class lectures feeling a little too slow for me.
I have really liked learning about the plotting functions within seaborn and matplotlib,I didn't like the Google forms as they sometimes closed too quickly before I could finish my responses.
I enjoy the interesting questions asked during class. It makes you think and it is kind of fun to discuss these questions with someone in class.  I feel like it helps me learn different perspectives while ,"For me, it is the assignments and labs because they take a bit of my time to finish. Maybe it is cause I came into this class knowing Java it would be nice to have some guidance/master doc explaining syntax and functions."
"I have enjoyed the most about learning, practicing, and applying methods of data tidying and analysis. I enjoyed this the most because I am a mechanical engineering student and work at an engineering startup company where data analysis is very important. The skills I'm learning here are more in depth than the MATLAB level of data analysis I learn in my engineering classes and share many of the same python skills as what I learn at my job making it feel very relevant and important. ","I have enjoyed least debugging grading issues with the assignments. For example, I accidently deleted a cell and that caused me a difficult rabbit hole of trying to debug the issue. Another example is the csv wouldn't load in one cell causing the next cell to not pass an assert and would confuse me trying to validate the assignment. Although this does not happen often and I understand how it is unavoidable but it has been a little difficult. "
I like the interactiveness of the lectures.,I wish that we could do projects with less than 4 people.
coding,none
What I enjoyed most about COGS 108 so far is the well structured of the lecture with detailed examples. The professor explained the abstract concept of data science very well with many examples so I can better understand the concept and be ready to apply them in our group project.,"None, everything is good. "
I find the datasets that are used in class to be interesting.,I do not particularly like how all the due dates are on Sundays because I feel like that just enables me to procrastinate more.
"What I have enjoyed most about COGS 108 is the style of lectures we have had. I like how we can experiment with our own notebooks during the lecture, as well as the various examples Professor Ellis gives for concepts that are a part of slideshows.","Something I have liked the least is having difficulty with labs/assignments when something in them was not covered in class. I understand that we should work to arrive at a certain answer, but I struggle at times as someone with a very basic knowledge of python. "
"Projects, good practices",Nothing
How chill the class is when I have two other very time and mental commitment heavy classes,The fact that two of my group members take so damn long to respond 
The way the assignments are structured. They are very detailed and are great for diving into data analysis,The datahub was confusing to use in order to find assignments and how to submit. 
I liked working in a group and being able to choose the topic we are interested in researching and doing our project about,N/A
"I enjoyed learning about more of the non-technical side of data science. Although I already have some data science experience, it was good to know that there should be ethical considerations and processes to keep in mind when working on DS projects. ",Some of the content that was taught earlier either did not feel too relevant to the class or should not have gone into much depth. Some examples are the Fermi estimations and scientific notation review. 
learning about the different topics,Using datahub is annoying sometimes
"The different topics that were covered in the lecture, and how they are all related to data science",Figuring out GitHub with little demo 
The different topics introduced,"Jupyter notebook has been difficult to use with GitHub, I had never used it Jupyter before just GitHub so it took a while to figure out how to setup the notebook "
"It is very straightforward, and I understand what is expected of me.","The class layout, datahub, and github repo are very confusing. As a student, it is easiest when everything is in one place, and I have to go searching for a lot of assignments and things. There are also a lot of things due, but I am glad that they are consistently due at the same time every week so I can have some ease from that."
It is fun to learn new techniques of data analysis.,N/A
"I've really enjoyed mostly actually doing the assignment, discussion or otherwise. I also like the fact that we have edstem, it really helps when I'm struggling.","The biggest thing I've disliked is actually figuring out a proposal for our project because none of my group members had ideas and we really struggled with even coming up with examples or topics to get our ideas flowing. The directions are also way too vague, and it would've been much better appreciated if some broad genres or some ideas could be given to us to help out as to what we'd have liked to do. "
learning data science methods,mmm nothing? it's kinda a cool class
"Interactive class activities, especially the ones that make us think before knowing the solution!",Sometimes I feel like I'm falling behind but I have managed to be caught up so far.
"One of the things I’ve enjoyed most about COGS 108 is learning how to apply data science concepts to real-world problems. The course goes beyond just theoretical knowledge—it provides practical skills for analyzing and interpreting data, which are incredibly valuable in many fields.","While I’ve really enjoyed COGS 108 overall, one challenge I’ve faced is that some of the assignments don’t always directly relate to the lecture material. At times, it feels like we are expected to figure things out on our own rather than following a clear step-by-step connection from the lectures.
 I do however understand that this approach is intentional—it pushes us to think critically, problem-solve, and develop independence in working with data, which are essential skills for real-world data science"
In class lecture attendance questions -- help me solidify some concepts,Assignments -- not really enjoyed the least. The quality of questions can be a bit confusing
The fact that Python can be applied to real-world data analysis problems is interesting to me. ,When I run into a coding problem or an unfamiliar problem that I have no idea where to start. 
Brainstorming new project ideas with my group,"The morning time of the lecture (9 am is quite early), And the 2pm lecture clashes with another class for me"
"I learned a lot about analyzing and visualizing data, as well as tools of doing so, and seeing the usecases for real life data","Using the jupyter notebook system is somewhat of a pain. Also, as a transfer commuter student (living at home), not having a live zoom option (like we did during the day of the lockdown) is a real pain, as the drive (takes a lot of time) and parking (extremely hard to find) can be extremely difficult and tiring to deal with."
When you mentioned the fart gasses. That was quite the humorous and intellectual ,Something I am adamently not liking in this course is the ratio. I wanted more men in this class
"Class, it’s interesting ","Lab assignments, tedious "
I enjoyed the most about COGS108 is working with my teammates and figuring out which topic we wanna chose for final project. it has been fun and excited,"The thing i enjoyed least is woking on assignment, it could be frustrating sometimes"
The labs and assignment,Nothing
"I liked how we did surveys in class, and then our data is displayed after, makes me look forward to what everyone else had put. ",The attendance ec only being 0.5% makes it seem like it is not as worth it if I had missed already 1-2 classes.
I have enjoyed meeting my team and discussing what we are doing moving forward.,The labs and lectures are a little slow and boring sometimes. I feel like the speed of the lectures could be a little faster. 
I enjoyed answering open-ended questions during the lectures. Making estimations about the data like Fermi Estimation was a fun activity. Discussing with the classmates and dealing with hypothetical questions were also entertaining.,The classroom felt a bit too crowded at first.
"I've enjoyed doing the Assignments and Discussions on JupyterHub because they're so organized and the instructions are clear enough for us to write code yet challenging at the same time, enough for us to learn more along the way.",I would say just not enough time spent on learning GitHub as a class. Exploring the application itself.
"I learnt a lot from assignments and labs, especially the graph generation and analysis are important practical data science skills to acquire. ",I do not get inspiration about my project topic through lectures. I feel like it would be better if there was a lecture regarding data science project explorations. 
I really like how the course tries to emphasize the data isn't always objective and that how it is presented matters a lot. ,Datahub is always broken when it comes to running Discussions and Assignments.
Coding and seeing all the graphs,How long the assignments are at times.
I really like the assignment and how it is guided,How early classes are. Especially in the mornings with the weather I have trouble getting up early enough.
The lectures have been really good. Love the explanations given by professor,Nothing
I like when real world examples or in class demonstrations are used in the lectures. They make the concepts easier to understand by showing how they apply in reality.,Nothing comes to mind at the moment.
data analysis and experience ,too much data science attendance 
I like the collaborative work that we are able to accomplish.,"I think the deadlines are a little bit tight, but I think they are manageable. "
Understanding how to use python to manipulate and present user research clearly and professionally,"Github is new to me and confusing… I know many in the class are experienced with it, but since it isn’t a prereq I don’t feel like there’s been enough explanation of the basics at times. I also wish assignment code was more directly related to lecture content. I’d just prefer more support on that end. "
I like how the lectures explains data manipulation and processing step by step and gives us a chance to practice in the weekly assignments.,"Maybe the weekly timed review quiz, since it only allows one attempt and has a 15 minutes time limit."
I enjoyed learning how to code in a data science way because I am a CS major and I don't really get to use my coding skills in data analysis / exploratory ways.,I think the quizzes because it is a little stressful that it is timed 15 minutes and you cant see the score till a lot later.
"I enjoy everything about this class. The assignments and discussions are really interesting, and I find them engaging and easy to follow. I also appreciate how the class is structured in a way that makes learning the material enjoyable and manageable. For instance, having Assignment every other weeks and Discussions each weeks. ",The group project has been my least favorite part because I prefer working independently. Coordinating schedules and communicating with others to plan and discuss tasks can take a lot of time.
Assignments aren't too difficult. And theyre pretty straightforward,nothing
"I have enjoyed learning about data analysis and the different ways we could visualize data. Through this course, I am realizing that there are so many things which can be done with data which makes it important to be cautionary about ethics and privacy.","I think I am enjoying the course so far, it would be helpful if we could have access to all discussion slides and if they could go more over the things expected in assignments/labs."
I really like the interactive assignments and labs on Jupyter Notebook. I feel like they're very clear in the instructions and what each cell should do (the assert functions definitely help in this part). ,I wish the lectures and homework material were a bit more interconnected with each other. 
"I've enjoyed how easy the material is to grasp, and the assignments are clear and straightforward.","So far, I haven't encountered anything that stands out as particularly challenging or unenjoyable. The course content and structure have been straightforward, and the assignments are clear, so there's nothing in particular that I would say I dislike."
What I’ve enjoyed most about COGS 108 is getting to work with real datasets and applying what we learn to actual problems. It’s satisfying to see patterns emerge from messy data and figure out how to make sense of it. The flexibility in the final project is also a big plus—it makes the class feel more relevant to personal interests.,What I’ve liked least is having to constantly flip through lecture notes to find specific commands or methods. It would be helpful to have a more organized reference sheet or a quick-access guide instead of searching through multiple slides and notebooks.
The clean and interactive style of the lectures.,None so far.
The discussion assignments have been really interactive and enjoyable. I think they really help us with understanding what we need to do for our programming assignments and also our upcoming projects.,"I don’t think there is anything is particularly that I have not liked. Maybe a bit more clarity on programming assignments because some so far in PA2, the instructions were quite strange and hard to follow."
The way the course is taught is easy to follow,"Group work, my team does not seem very proactive"
I've liked the labs and homeworks! I think incorporating interesting datasets makes them that much more enjoyable.,I have no qualms about COGS 108 so far.
"I am enjoying the labs and assignments as I feel I am learning new techniques for using python, pandas, and the other packages, as well as all of its built-in features and methods.","I feel like the timeline for the group project should be more spaced out, for example making the previous project review due earlier and having more checkpoint group assignments."
Labs are intuitive and fun to work with.,Assignments are very hard to pass all the tests.
The hands-on labs and assignments ,n/a
I like that I can work through the discussions and assignments at my own pace rather than a timed test.,It is difficult for me to complete a group project this quarter. 
I like the lecture’s especially about how to be a good data scientist ,I would say the coding. I feel like between lecture content does not really help with coding assignments much
"The challenge of completing the assignments. The directions explain what to do, but it often takes a bit of trial and error to actually follow them correctly.","The parts of class where we discuss things with our neighbors is overwhelming for me. With so many people talking at the same time, it is difficult to have a productive interaction with neighbors and usually leaves me in more of a state of confusion/nervousness than before."
we can collect our own data to solve a problem,too much assignment
"I like the topics of discussion. Especially the political analysis of D4 - quite an interesting set of observations, prompted me to go and read a little bit more about the topic.",N/A
I've enjoyed exploring datasets and having the freedom to research any topic we would like. The vast amount of datasets online is intriguing and makes me want to research everything.,"The assignments have been quite stressful because after losing points on the first assignment, I've been overthinking every hidden test case to ensure that I can get full credit and not lose any points."
"I like how interactive the course is. There are many opportunities to exercise data science and thinking skills during lectures. Additionally, I like the slides that are used during lecture. I believe I learn better when the slides have graphics and visuals that correspond with what is being said out loud. ",I do not have any complaints about COGS 108.
I have enjoyed the lecture style because it is interactive and engaging.,"I don't like the lack of clarity for some discussion assignments in the instructions. I know it would be better to attend the discussion, but in situations where we are unable to, I feel the discussion assignments aren't clear enough to do on your own. "
Lectures. Ellis is brilliant at explaining things concisely at a high level. Her clear expertise makes me want to listen.,Datahub :( I would prefer some form of gradescope as most of my other assignments are submitted there. 
I have enjoyed the informative and applicable labs and discussions. I really like how they aren't too lengthy and are not repetitive. It encompasses the lecture topics very well.,I wish classes were more interactive amongst students instead of just following along with the lecture and doing the check in questions.
"I've enjoyed the pace and teaching style the most about COGS 108. I am not the strongest at coding, so having visuals and going in depth with the code in class really helps when I have to do the assignments and discussions.",There aren't any pain points that really stand out to me. 
"I really like all the topics that we are covering and the way professor Ellis is lecturing, and I really like the project we are about to do (I am also nervous cause all these are so new for me )","My answer is not necessary something I do not like, it is just extra challenging for me: 
The fact that we are doing everything in GitHub and the way most of the thing are being done in the class are so new to me and challenging and sometimes it stresses me out but it is not a bad thing at all and I am excited for the day that I get comfortable with all of these. "
No midterms/exams! I like that the main thing is a final project because I can just focus on learning the material.,I feel like I haven't been as engaged with the lectures recently. 
"Working on the project with my group, as it is really fun and I feel like we can use what we learned in class towards a real project.",Nothing really
I really like the way lectures are conducted and how they encourage us to engage with the materials in a hands on manner.,"I think that sometimes the Labs are harder than the actual assignments, which can be seen as a good thing because they better prepare us for the Assignments, however, it actually felt like the opposite was true with A2 and D3, it felt like doing A2 first would have made D3 easier."
I enjoyed learning about pandas,Jupyter notebooks just dont like it personally
"How hands-on this class is, very different from a lot of other classes here at ucsd.",Nothing! This class is great!
I have enjoyed how we essentially have free range over what our project will be and how we choose to approach the data science question that we choose,"For me personally, the lectures have been really slow, and I feel like there is a sometimes between what we learn in lecture and the skills that we need to implement in the discussion worksheets and assignments. "
I have most enjoyed the process of learning about how to graph visualizations to answer questions of interest and exploring how it gives new meaning to a dataset. It is exciting to analyze datasets with various graph visualizations and anticipate how it will help answer questions of interest.,"My least favorite thing about COGS 108 is that there are so many assignments (DX assignment, AX assignment, weekly quiz, group submission) that are all due on Sunday. It can be overwhelming at times to make sure I am turning in every assignment on time."
I enjoy the feeling of accomplishment I get whenever I complete a coding assignment correctly and punctually after debugging.,Debugging has been quite difficult and I would like some more guidance.
"I have enjoyed learning more about the different Python libraries used for data science. This is my first data science class, so I have learned a lot. I also think that the workload is very manageable so far.","Sometimes, assignments (A1, A2) have taken me longer because I get stuck (especially if we haven't covered something in lecture), but eventually I am able to figure it out."
My favorite part about Cogs 108 is the lectures. They're very informative and easy to understand,My least favorite part about Cogs 108 is learning github. Github is confusing to learn about but im doing a lot better. I dont really have a least favorite part about this class.
"I have enjoyed learning a lot of data science related topics in this class so far. Subjects I have learned before but wasn't too familiar with, such as EDA now are becoming topics I understand way better. ",What I liked least is having both assignments and labs due.
Discussion labs and assignments. I believe they are engaging and fun to complete.,N/A.
I really enjoy the experimental and interactive questions during class. I think this is what differentiates my core data science classes as I am a student in that major. I really like how it is not too coding or technical heavy and I am able to understand content at a pace that I am comfortable at learning the content. ,"What I like least about COGS 108 so far is probably the assignments because they seem a bit difficult or time consuming at times. However, I understand these assignments are essential to understand and grasp the concepts that we will need to complete our final project."
Learning how to collect information and clean it and wrangle it has been super interesting.,"I think since my team and I have vastly different interests, trying to come up with a question which is equally engaging for all of us has been a bit of a challenge"
"I enjoy how Professor Ellis lectures, she goes through things slow enough that I can keep up, but talks fast enough that I don't get bored :)",Sometimes I feel like asking for definitions of certain vocab words in the quizzes isn't 100% representative of understanding.
I like learning about ways to manipulate data using Python. Using code to transform the data and produce outputs that can be meaningfully interpreted is interesting.,Trying to coordinate with team members to work on the project assignments has been a bit difficult. It was hard to get a hold of all the members before the first assignment was due.
I enjoy manipulating and cleaning data because I feel like it's a practical and useful skill that I wish I was more efficient at,I just can't remember stuff from COGS 18 so all my code takes an excruciating amount of trial and error or looking up documentation that I can't remember.
I liked seeing the survey results right away during class.,Lots of assignments that I am having a hard time keeping track of. Also I wish we learned more technical commands or had a key/guide of some functions that could help with pandas.
I have really enjoyed the aspect of getting to know my groupmates through the group project.,"Sometimes I feel like the assignments are a bit vague in JupyterNotebooks, and I wish there could be more assistance."
The interesting visualizations we can create from data and how to make sense of them.,Nothing as such I am having a great time in the course. The only negative experience has been a confusion in the team formation for the group project where we had to be reassigned a different team and caused delays in the project timeline.
"I've overall just liked learning about the applications of data science and actually getting hands on experience and demonstrations in class of how things work (like pandas, etc.)",Some of the labs have been a little too hard or the grading too strict
Using plotting libraries like seaborn,Datahub can be slow sometimes
Enjoyed working on the project.,not much class participation opportunities. 
chill-ness of the class,re-learning about the graphs etc 
I really enjoy the structure of the class. I truly wish I took this course before my first internship; the usage of github and jupyter notebooks feels practically indistinguishable from an enterprise onboarding environment. ,"Would have preferred to do the project solo, but I get wanting to facilitate collaboration due to the reality of working on a team. "
"I have enjoyed the pace of the class. Even though lectures so far are a bit behind with the material being covered in discussion sections, the course schedule has been easy to understand and for us to follow. Professor Ellis mentioned having the first few weeks of the quarter discuss ethics and other information regarding our project, which I believe was a good switch in the course schedule (especially helped my group and I with our project proposal and further planning of our project), compared to discussing ethics towards the end of the quarter.","It was mentioned during one of the lectures that as an upper-division course, this course will introduce us to concepts, but it is up to us to practice those concepts outside of lecture time. This has been something that I have been struggling with--even though I enjoy the pace of the course, I do still find myself getting stuck with how to approach assignments or labs, despite attending discussion sections. I believe a bit of a deeper dive into how to approach assignments/labs (similar to the structure of COGS 18) would help a lot."
Homework are not too hard. ,I don't really like using data. I have that much.. 
Working with my team!,Lab assignments are a bit confusing to understand sometimes.
I honestly enjoy the lectures the most. They are good mix of coding and theory. I also like the in - class surveys which makes the class more interactive. I think the lectures are helping me gain real data science skills that can help me in my project.  ,"What I like the least are the assignments. I think they are a bit too long and so take a lot of time to complete. I think later on in the quarter when the final project deadline nears, I will have to devote more time to it rather than assignments. I don't reject the usefulness of assignments when it comes to refining coding skills but I think it would be better if they were a bit shorter. "
I like doing the hands-on work and actually testing the code. ,I do not like when my code doesn't work and it takes me hours to figure it out :(
The one thing I have enjoyed the MOST about COGS 108 are the labs and assignments. I like how it's formatted around helping students solidify and practice what they learned in class. I feel like they're pretty engaging.,"The one thing I like LEAST about COGS 108 is that despite having a group of (3/4) for the project, individuals still able to be added on."
I like the flexibility of the class where labs aren't mandatory for people who feel confident about the upcoming lab assignments. It saves time and if people do need help there are many sessions to attend.,Something I liked least was having to look up a lot of functions or documentations for the code that we used in assignments. Having to look up different coding documentations make it harder to approach the assignment because it can be overwhelming and get lost. Having hints or something that refers to a documentation that we were supposed to use would make it helpful to know what types of functions are expected.
"I enjoy the lectures the most, they are engaging and thought provoking. The examples and practice questions are very helpful, and easy to follow along even at home. ","I like the labs/discussion assignment the least, only because I struggle the most on the labs. Some of the wording can be confusing, especially when the prompt is sort of vague. For example D4 asks to look at the data we scrapped and look at the age statistics, however I wasn't sure if it meant to look at the previous data frame, or the main data frame."
I liked interacting with the Jupyter notebooks. The format of them is organized and easy to use.,It would be nice to have a centralized place for all of the functions that we use in this class. It seems like a big chunk of the time spent on labs or assignments is digging through Jupyter notebooks and documentation for a specific function or parameter if we don't remember it off the top of our heads. 
I think in class when there is participation it’s really fun and the communication with other classmates.,I think it’s hard to keep up with the content sometimes
I like professor's teaching method and able to explain everything clearly. Also the demo in the class using Panda is really helpful too.,It is a big class. Hence sometimes students will talk during the lecture and it is a distraction.
"I have enjoyed the lectures the most, though they are not mandatory to attend, I have found them to be really helpful, given our project. I feel that it prepares us to be good researchers and interpreters and these skills would be very useful in life.",The people in the group project are not at all contributing. 
"I enjoy working in a group and getting to learn from everyone, which makes projects a lot of fun. I also enjoy the interesting topics that are explored in labs and homeworks.","It feels like to look for course info, sometimes I need to search on datahub, github, and canvas. I think it would be great if there was a centralized place with everything linked that I could reference."
"This class is pretty fun, especially when the code is able to run :))))",When the code can't run
I have enjoyed the different techniques for data analysis and visualization while applying them to genuinely interesting case studies.,"Although concepts like data ethics are important, I would enjoy learning more practical applications of data analysis over theoretical frameworks and guidelines."
"Ive been introduced to data cleaning before, but I like how much more Ive learned about data cleaning, and expanding that topic. ","Sometimes the google forms stress me out when I dont submit in time, its too quick of time and im a slow typer"
"The surveys we do in class, in last lecture one of the respondents said something about ""farts"" and it was quite funny. The professor makes this class much more fun and makes it easier to pay attention for longer periods.",When the class tends to feel boring and the energy is not there.
"Most the classes you take in college are more theory based so I've been enjoying cogs 108 because its the only fully practical course I've taken, that is the project is all the matters really. So I am pretty excited to get started on my project.","There is certainly a steep learning curve for people who have not had much coding or data science experience so maybe a bit more direction in this realm, however I do think jumping straight into a difficult project is a phenomenal way to learn though it may be very time consuming."
"Formatting - everything is very well flushed out and helpful - especially in contrast to cse 107 with Nadia - that shit sucks, the professor and ta's are grifting: no homeworks graded yet, no homework answers released after deadlines, piazza questions go unanswered, etc. In comparison to that, the professor and TA's of Cogs 108 are on top of their work!",quizzes - needlessly stressful
"I have enjoyed learning various data science related skills such as using Pandas and seaborn. Since I am a computer science major, I haven't really gotten a chance to play around with these tools, and this course has given me insight into them.","I think that the lectures are a bit slow paced. I understand that this is meant to be more of an introduction class, but since I have experience in the software engineering industry, it felt a bit slow."
I’ve enjoyed the content the most so far. Specifically working with pandas and other programs for visualization and data organization. It all seems very relevant and important ,"While I like the fact that lecture time is split between general strategies for data science research and some specific note taking via Jupiter notebooks, I feel as if there’s not enough of it in the lectures. While I understand there needs to be some sort of discovery and research element to the discussions and assignments, I think going over more specifics (coding) for the assignments would help a lot :)"
"I like that we're doing an overview of everything data science comprises, from EDA to ethics. The professor is also super chill, and I think all the participation activities we're doing in class, like the Feynman estimation, are helping us think critically about what our data looks like. ",It would be great if we moved a little faster. 
I liked the assignments and lab works  ,"I did not like that the quizzes are timed for 15 minutes, where they could be helpful from the perspective of learning for the students if they were not timed."
"I really like that COGS 108 is a very hands-on and informative class, without overloading students with work and stressing them out. I also appreciated the group-formation system early in the quarter, it felt very helpful and organized. The content is interesting as well, because I find python pandas pretty fun.","I'm actually not a huge fan of how everything is due on one day, although I admit it's up to me to not procrastinate, I think it would be easier to organize my time and mentally separate assignments from labs if they were due on separate days. "
I enjoy the lectures the most. Professor Ellis breaks down the content and make the lectures very digestible and engaging.,"I don't have anything in particular that I dislike. If I had to choose, it would be the group project. I wasn't aware the group project would take a big portion of this class, and I came in not knowing anyone in this class. I had to choose a random group to join, so I think it is a bit harder for me to take lead and contribute more ideas to my group. "
"Learning about Github & Basics around it, working wtih team. ","Assignments, having a little hard time with it but I understand if I spend lots of time on it."
"So far I have enjoyed learning to use Python in practical ways, and seeing examples in lectures using data collected from our class.","There isn't anything that stands out that I've liked least about this course up to this point. If I had to pick something, it would be that finding the current lecture material isn't too intuitive. I often get mixed up about which PDF or Jupyter Noteboook is being used in lecture. "
I have enjoyed looking for project ideas with my group,the labs/assignments
"I appreciate that it's more of a chill class compared to technically heavy and having large expectations on students to bring results, rather than learning through the process. I can tell the professor wants us to truly learn how to solve a data science-related question, rather than ","The questions in the discussion coding assignments (d4 in particular) have been worded pretty badly, meaning its hard to understand what they're asking for. There's a difference between asking a question and make the coder really THINK of how to manipulate their dataframe to get what they want, versus implying that you want the coder to do something, but are ambiguous about it. For example, one of the questions in d4 asks about retrieving a subset of the age dataframe of elements that overlap with the politics dataset. But then, in the question before it, it asks 'what if we got all the years of 1950s till now?'  When I read this problem, I thought that you were asking us to do two different things: retrieve all the data from both dataframes from 1950s to now, and then, merge two dataframes based on overlapping attributes. I hope you understand what I'm saying. 

Please, also, grammar check the questions you're trying to ask in the coding assignments. Reading badly worded questions and also seeing grammar mistakes makes the credibility and trustworthiness I have in the academic team in cogs 108 so much lower."
"I enjoyed doing the assignments and discussions because I have never done these types of assignments before where guidelines are given on how and when to use different functions using tools like Pandas and Seaborn, and it allows me to enjoy learning in the process genuinely.","Frankly, there is nothing that I liked least about the COGS 108 course itself. But if I had to pick one, I would say the class period. 9:00 AM is too early for me, and I cannot attend the lectures at 2:00 PM due to a conflict with another class."
I enjoy the ability to look over the notes from lecture while simultaneously working on a discussion post or assignment. ,"I have liked the aspect of assignments having thorough instructions and less descriptive instructions for discussions the least. It causes me to attempt assignments first and discussions, which are supposed to be the ""easier"" between the two, afterwards. "
Learning how to use pandas since it has been relatively easy to understand and quite interesting.,Having to schedule times to meet up for the project since I live off campus and if we want to meet in person I usually have to go out of my way to go to campus.
just the data science part of it,the amount of coidng 
I like how we can teamp up and do a free project,na
Doing the labs and assignments,Issues with datahub
I have most enjoyed the lecture and assignment styles of this course because I feel that they are relatively engaging and break things down in a manner that is easy to follow along and learn from. ,I don't really have any issues with the course other than maybe sometimes we can go over things quite fast in lecture but this is easily solved by reviewing the podcasts. 
"I loved being able to refine my Python skills through all the assignments and discussion labs. I want to be able to talk about my Python usage and skill-awareness in interviews, so being able to learn about other packages and how to use them in Python is quite helpful. On top of that, I can use them to solve basic algorithm problems in Python.","The one thing I've liked least about COGS 108 so far is the inability to connect with my group well. I'm trying to jog conversation and get the ball rolling for the project deliverables, but it's become quite hard to gather ideas and worse yet, conclude and agree on a singular idea. I hope to be able to improve this as time continues."
"The coding has been kind of fun! Challenging, but repetitive and good practice for the final project. I'm actually really interested in coding so it's been fun sorting and graphing data from the D and A assignments. ","Although I said the coding has been fun, it's also daunting and overwhelming. I'm definitely scared for the final project, as my teammates and I are going to have to take the knowledge we've learnt through the assignments and apply them to actual data sets. However, the concepts itself presented in COGS 108 haven't been too difficult."
I have enjoyed working with my group on the project. I enjoy discussing what we want to find in our datasets and what our project will be about.,I sometimes find the assignments to be a little obtuse and difficult to figure out.
The lectures!!! I was scared of them being snoozy but professor does a good job keeping us engaged ,Some of the assignments are difficult for someone who doesn't have a lot of experience w python
"The project discussion with my teammates, because we all have some interesting ideas, and  I really enjoyed discussing with them.","The github stuff, because they are a little bit annoying"
That the quizzes are related and often whats in the lecture/lecture notes.,"Sometimes the discussion and assignment tasks are not as clear, which causes rereads and multiple trial and error before understanding."
"I have enjoyed the lectures, and the support that is offered the most. I think lecture is very helpful, specifically when Professor Ellis provides examples, or has us answer questions (on the google forms). Personally, this helps in making complicated material easier to understand. I also have enjoyed the support that is offered. There are a lot of resources that are available in this class and I think the Professor has always made it clear that there is always support for us.",Something that I have liked the least in COGS 108 (but I understand that they are made that way to specifically help us get more practice) is the length of the assignments. I think they can be quite long and time-consuming.
I have enjoyed the class's attendance policies. It is nice to know that I can always go to the other lecture time if I need to. It also encourages attendance without making attendance more stressful.,"Nothing, I feel like the class is fair and rigorous."
"One thing I enjoyed the most was collaborating on a group project. I liked how flexible it was, letting us choose a topic we were genuinely interested in and discuss it together. The lectures were also really helpful and kept me engaged throughout the full 50 minutes.","One thing I liked least about COGS 108 was the lab assignments. Some instructions felt vague and ambiguous, which sometimes led me to misinterpret them. There were a few times when I completed a task differently than intended, only to realize the mistake after double-checking with the TA."
Pace of lectures and assignments ,Discussion assignments can be a little hard
"So far, I am enjoying lectures as they help me better understand how to code. Although I am very new to python coding and haven't coded in general for years, I am learning more than I ever did. I mostly enjoy the lessons that go over various ways to utilize code to analyze and organize data sets. This is something I think would be useful in my career path which will include lots of researching!",Nothing really.
The aspect of COGS108 I enjoy the most is the group project that will help build my data analysis and coding skills. It is my first time utilizing pandas and I think it is pretty fun and not as complicated to use. The group project is also something I look forward to working on rather than having to complete a final exam.,"I do not like how some of the assignments and discussion work have confusing questions that could not simply be answered by looking at the notes. Obviously, we have to think outside the box to solve these problems but some of the data visualization problems have been really tricky and I had to find help online since the tests were also strict."
Using codes to analyze data and draw graphs with them.,Feeling hard for me who are not cognitive science major.
"I've enjoyed our lectures on the more soft skill oriented topics, like Data Ethics and Privacy. These are topics we don't discuss as much in my other DS classes, so its interesting to learn more about them.","It has been difficult to connect with my team mates so far, since collaboration with them has been completely asynchronous. This makes it difficult to plan and move forward with the main project."
The team project as well as interactive class components (the questions definitely help maintain engagement and curiosity!),"Lots of deadlines, but there is a lot of course content so I understand"
Learning about data science and going in-depth in python.,Homework is due on Sundays. Especially the quizzes that only come out on Friday afternoon. I don't want to be doing schoolwork during my weekends.
I enjoyed getting an introduction into the world of data science and how I could potentially use this in the future.,Not much to say
The assignments and discussions because it's been a while since I last worked in Python and its a nice refresher that isn't too complex. ,N/A
"I enjoy that the assignments and labs have interesting data sets, and challenging but not too difficult aspects.",I enjoy how this class is set up and taught; n/a.
I really enjoyed the coding assignments and discussions because they’re really effective in brushing up my memory on key concepts!,I think I dislike the final project because it’s something that involves multiple people and scheduling is very difficult for us.
"I enjoyed learning about pandas and how to manipulate dataframes to help me analyze data. Since I am thinking about going into data analysis, this course has helped me learn what the career may entail. ",The one thing I like least about COGS108 the instructions are some of the coding work can be ambiguous.
I enjoyed learning about python and how we can use it to visualize data,I liked everything in COGS 108 so far
I’ve enjoyed the exploration of the projects and the dive into the aspects of data science.,The assignments as they can get confusing at times.
Actually looking at data and learning how it might impact people.,"Sometimes, the assignments doesn't quite match up the lecture."
meeting my team during sectiom,labs
"I enjoyed getting to meet my group members and hanging out with them. Knowing that I'll be working with familiar people with the project and people that I'm comfortable with, I think we're able to come up with a good project idea.",I don't like how I can't redeem what I got wrong. I believe having a redemption system where I'm able to correct what I did wrong and incentivize getting points for that would be nice and beneficial to all.
Choosing our own research topic. I feel like that allows us to really explore fields that we're truly interested in so that we make the most out of our education.,Practical applications. Sometimes I feel like some aspects of lecture aren't applicable or isn't clear regarding labs or assignments.
I actually enjoyed getting put into a random group because it forced me to meet as well as talk to new people.,"While I liked getting put into a group to meet new people, the fear of letting them down because I am in a group is what I like the least."
"I have enjoyed the discussion labs so far! They are fun to do, and I enjoy practicing and testing my coding skills!","The attendance being done through QR code, my back camera does not work, and it makes it hard for me to do the attendance! "
I love working on the assignments and feel like they present as a good measure of testing our learning while still being short and comprehensive. ,Don’t have any major concerns but I don’t like that all assignments are due weekly on the same day. 
Probably just practicing and reviewing when doing the labs ,"For me, I’m a data science major in my fourth year and the topics feel very repetitive. I don’t feel like I’m learning anything new. "
I have enjoyed the lecture contents the most.,I have least liked the discussion assignments.
I like learning the code and also we have the chance to watch the guest lecture to get to know more about the field and career path.,Maybe that there are few things due each week but I already get to used to the pace for this class.
I enjoy the fun lectures,Things are speeding up in regards to  the final project and the labs have become more difficult and longers.
I enjoyed the assignments and getting to put all the concepts from lecture to practice,None on the top of my head; it is a great class
python and the data wrangling ,nothing 
Learning about Github,The lecture slides not being uploaded to Canvas because it is harder to access them with  my phone through Datahub and Github
I have found the lectures to be quite helpful.,What I have liked the least are the lab sections. I feel like lab sections could be more helpful if we go more over the material we will see in the assignment rather than just letting us figure it out by ourselves.
Meeting with my group and discussing what we want to work on for the rest of the quarter,there isnt anything I dislike about the course so far.
The thing I enjoyed the class would be how the lectures are structured,Maybe I would like the lectures to be a little more engaging 
So far I have enjoyed doing the quizzes and thinking about the proposal for the project in this class. ,"I have least enjoyed doing the A assignments since they tend to take forever kinda, and they're are little harder. "
"The assignments, working with Python on Jupyter and debugging. Also the super nice professor and the way she brings in interesting examples to the lecture content.",Also debugging :)
The pace has really allowed me to learn the content without feeling pressurized for exams.,n/a
So far I enjoy the group work a lot. Come up with interesting data science project with other people,The early class
The discussion notebook assignments. The project,Having to find random teammates because I only knew 2 other people in the class. I wish it was 3-5 people instead!
I really like the techical topic in this project ,We didn't really go into seaborn 
I enjoy doing the easier discussions where it step by step explains how to do something because I feel like I am learning.,"I didn't really like the pushing and pulling stuff for github because I was really lost, especially since I didn't have a macbook like my TA."
I have enjoyed learning new things about Python and how to develop graphs.,The assignments have been a little tricky and stressful since I am unsure of what the output is supposed to be.
"I think pandas is a very useful technique. Even in my major, I find it extremely valuable, and I really enjoyed playing around with it. It made data manipulation and analysis much easier and more intuitive, allowing me to explore datasets and uncover insights efficiently.",NA
Interacting with my group project team members. It's cool doing a project on something I am actually interested in. ,The pace of the class is pretty fast for me given I have only taken Cogs 18 in the past. I think my other team members who are CS majors take this class and it is super easy for them.
I enjoy the lectures and walking through the code in class. ,"I don’t really like how fast we move, since it’s a lot of new content very fast."
The lectures. Prof. Ellis is a great lecturer.,Nothing.
I think the lectures have been super engaging and interesting to listen too. I like the examples in class.,"Sometimes the assisngment instructions can be a little unclear. For instance, the matplot assignment it was kind of confusing to understand what you wanted and we had to look at the test cases. "
I really enjoy the time to get hand-on project experience related to the knowledge I learnt,N/A
"The structure: I love the way homework is set up on the same day of the week, I also appreciate the straight-forward nature of the grading.

Lecture: Always enjoyable to attend and most importantly - very accessible since there are two times and a podcast. ",The assignments can have some issues from the client side. Maybe a move away from jupyterhub to other options. 
I think the lectures are fun and informative and are not too jargony for a non coding major,I think the talk with your neighbor works in some classes but this class should avoid it 
Plotting and working with data in Jupyter Notebook and answering real life questions using what we've learnt so far,"Sometimes debugging and figuring out what went wrong we my code can be a bit frustrating, but it's really satisfying after figuring out what the error was."
"How easy the class feels. Most of it feels practical, and great to know for our careers and future classes. ","Most of it is review from COGS 9, so there's not much for me to learn about regarding foundations of data science, so this feels more like a continuation of the course and actually applying what we learnt from the course itself."
The weekly python assignments because I get to work on my python skills. ,nothing really everything was explained and I didn't have much questions.
"I enjoyed learning python honestly, it seems like a fun language to learn and I'm excited to use it.","I think I least disliked how the jupyter notebook was not as user friendly to beginners to help them guide them through coding, cause my other friend is having a lot of trouble, but I'm doing fine due to my experience with coding."
I like how we are able to create a project based on a topic that we are interested in.,I feel like some lectures do not help me with how to solve the homework.
"I’ve enjoy being able to work on cells through data hub, and being able to take my code step by step. I also like how discussion is run, with a short review and time to ask the TA questions.","I don’t like how I’m often disconnected from Jupyter notebooks, or have issues with data hub such as problems with validation that aren’t due to my code."
"So far, I have enjoyed how interactive the course has been with the notebooks and the long descriptive explanations for the assignments. ",The thing I have least liked about Cogs 108 is how sometimes there are weird bugs in the assignments after submitting but it hasn't been a big issue so far since the professor and TA's have helped resolve them.
"I really enjoy the discussions. I feel like the notebook problems really helped my understand how to work with data, like organisation, manipulation, removing null. This all helped me a lot with my Economics research Lab too.",I don’t think there was anything Indisliked about the class so far. All the work is fair and manageable. 
The discussions and assignments are the most engaging because they help me practice what we're learning and preparing me for how to execute our project.,Some of the TAs in section aren't very helpful so I don't think it's worth it to go unless my group members want to meet during that time. There are a few sections I attended though were the TA is very insightful and helps out a lot!
"I enjoyed the lectures when you're using jupyter notebooks, it feels more interactive that way.",Datahub. It feels very barebones. There's no intellisense and it's hard to verify what I submitted.
I've really enjoyed learning how to use pandas because I think it can be very useful not just in school but in everyday life.,n/a
The lectures are really descriptive and help students understand the basic tops surrounding data science. I like how it is very organized and that there are different resources to help us learn the topics.,The assignments feel very tedious and require us to do more than what I feel might be necessary. This is mainly because I have learned these topics before so it feels repetitive. Though I can see how for someone that hasn't done this before the content on the assignments can be good practice.  
I enjoy the lecture a lot because professor is very patient.,"Communicating with team mates, not I don't like it, it's just pretty hard"
I like the group aspect of the class and the project component in this class. I always wished UCSD has more classes like this where its more self learning and more freedom of what we can do. ,"As of right now I don't really dislike anything about COGS 108, its living up to the expectations that I have for it !"
Learning pandas and applying it to practical settings through assignments.,Nothing.
I enjoyed the pacing of the lectures & the clarity of the professor while speaking. ,"I am not too comfortable with the amount of independence the assignments require (separate from the lecture, it feels like I have to self-teach myself some data science methods) but this is not that large of a problem. "
"Data manipulation, Pandas. I have experience with data science and I enjoyed the learning structure of how we were taught about data manipulation. ","Plot Graphs. Truthfully, I don't actually mind this, but I need an answer. Although, doing plot graphs and organizing them to have all data visible was a tad bit annoying as I had to do my own research to understand how to better represent data."
Assignments all in canvas so I can see when my assignments are due easily,Very basic since I'm a data science minor
"I enjoy working with a team, as this makes it seem like a professional setting. I think this aspect of project building is what's missing from other more 'academically rigerous' courses.","I wish attendence was calculated after lectures, because it's hard to remember when or how many days I skipped. Additionally, it's more convinent to have a hard coded statistic rather than conjecture."
"I've enjoyed the labs that we get to complete because it helps me understand the concepts better (ex: data wrangling, using pandas, etc). The format of the labs is effective for learning because it explains the concepts and then lets us write code as well. Testing out the code and trying to figure out how to fix the errors is beneficial to comprehend the material. ",One thing that I liked least about COGS 108 so far is how frustrating it can be when the code doesn't work for the assignments. I understand that it's part of the process of learning the material in class but I think this is the one thing that I liked the least.
"I really enjoy the lectures and the assignments to go with them, it's been a good refresher on Pandas for me.","Honestly not a whole lot, I like most things about this class. "
"I enjoyed the lectures of COGS 108, I think the main points are very well organized. I like the interactive forms to knowledge check the class. I think the free days for turning in assignments late has been a stress reliever as well and gives me flexibility.",i haven't really disliked anything in particular. 
I like the discussion part because I think it is a quite interactive way to make the class engaging. ,"I would say the DataHub is not always helpful sometimes, it gets stuck. "
The assignments seem pretty reasonable compared to what we learn in lecture. ,I don't really have an issues honestly. It has been an interesting class
I like how the class is very chill and open ended. Gives a lot of freedom and mimics an actual real life project,I feel like the class is too easy - coming from a physics and data science major.... i feel like im not learning much
I have enjoyed working on the group project. This is something I have enjoyed most because it is a project that our group decided on our own based on something we all find interesting. This component makes it fun to work on because we all have already had some sort of experiences or ideas with the topics that we enjoy learning about. ,"I am not sure if there is anything that I haven't liked least, but I think there is a bit more pressure sometimes to not miss a class because of our participation points despite it maybe being an inconvenience that week. However, this is something that is workable and not a problem as long as I am able to attend either the morning or afternoon class more so than I'd like to miss. "
I've enjoyed the Data Lab assignments-- they've been fun. And I've enjoyed learning to use seaborn. ,"Nothing, it's been an enjoyable class! Though, I'm starting to dislike Pandas as a library but that is separate from this class. "
I like just the topics and the way the class is structured in general. Homework and labs let you do things more hands on and feels like your doing the actual project but broken down into smaller steps which I really enjoy.,I wish assignment asserts were more clear on checking if your correct. Since I lost a bit of points for some very minor errors that I think the asserts should have been there to tell me rather than be a hidden assert.
Learning Pandas has been an interesting way to look at data visualization,Pandas debugging is frustrating because I'm not familiar with Python.
"Currently I am really enjoying the process of learning how to collaborate with others with a big final project. From the past 2 weeks or so, our team has started to collaborate and gotten to work with each other for our project. It was very fun learning about each others' strengths and weaknesses, along with how to compliment each other according to them.","I feel like some of the assignments and labs don't really align well with the lecture materials. While this is somewhat of a part of the structure of the class, I feel like when working on labs and assignments I have to go back to many different lecture slides and notebooks to understand what to do. "
The group work has been fun,Nothing so far
Lecture,github
I love learning about Pandas,The in-class lack of participation from others.
I've enjoyed having a light workload while still learning a large amount of material in detail and following along the lectures in our own jupyter notebooks.,nothing
"I enjoyed learning hands-on. Most classes you learn and get tested on. However, for this class, I like that we get to apply what we learn and practice our skills.","I wished there was a calendar on CANVAS to show due dates and what we are going to learn in class. I also wish there was a video that taught us how to use github (for example, showing us how to download github desktop and how you can use this to clone, pull, and push repos). I was a little lost on how to edit the project proposal until I went on Edstem and saw a post regarding this."
Overall really enjoy how structured the class is. The notebooks are really well designed it actually takes a way a good amount of the unnecessary stress a lot of classes have. The canvas and assignments are also perfectly structured so we know when what is due. Making the students job just to focus on the learning which is great!,n/a
"I love the pace of the lecture and material, and I found the lab and assignments to be very helpful for me to do some hands-on practice before working on the final project.",I hope the length of the assignments can be a little shorter.
"I've found attending lectures to be really helpful, and I've really enjoyed the data visualization and cleaning sections because they've been incredibly satisfying.",I've had some issues with communication in my group project that will hopefully improve with time. 
"I like the data processing knowledge I have learned so far, and I think it is very useful for real world practice","To be honest, I don't like group work very much. I think the students in this course come from different majors, so they pay different attention to this course and have different levels of commitment"
I think the lecture topics have been really interesting. The professor explains things very clearly and makes them engaging to learn about. The in-class questions and polls have been really helpful to check for understanding as well.,"I feel like it is kind of difficult/annoying in a way to work with packages all the time which I totally understand its the foundation of the class and important for us to practice. However, they are finicky and I run into a lot of issues on labs and assignments with them."
"The TAs have been super responsize and helpful, but the biggest highlight to me is the lectures. The lectures are so fun, even if I don't show up all the time (commuter struggles), the reason I go to school in the first place is to show up for COGS 108.","Nothing in particular, things have been pretty smooth!"
Meeting new friends and have experience doing project,jupiter notebook
"One of the most enjoyable aspects of COGS 108 has been the practical approach to learning how to code within the context of data science. The assignments challenge us to apply coding skills to solve real-world problems, which has significantly enhanced my understanding and ability to write functional code. Specifically, I appreciate how the course integrates Python programming with data analysis techniques. This hands-on experience not only bolsters my technical skills but also boosts my confidence in handling complex datasets and deriving meaningful insights from them. This course has made coding feel more accessible and relevant, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.",Nothing.
I like how interactive the class is. We can follow along with coding while we are learning about the concepts. ,-
"I really enjoyed having Ed to support our questions when we are doing all the assignments. When I have some questions with homework, I can not stress and just ask on Ed.","So far there is nothing I don’t like. Just sometimes I have trouble navigating where things are, given we have Canvas, GitHub, and Datahub, but I usually figure it out pretty quickly."
"Just talking and discussing with my teammates about the project, brainstorming ideas that sound fun to do.","Using datahub. I keep running into problems with it, like pulling lecture notes (which keeps saying error undefined and doesn't give me any error messages to know what's wrong)."
Learning about pandas and the different types of graphs,I wish we got more time to fill out the in class google forms
My groupmates,Banging my head on my keyboard trying to figure out why my code isnt working
Learning more about how to use GitHub and how to practice data science properly. Learning about the different ethics and ways to use data science properly. ,I wished we had more lectures where you coded with us so we could practice coding while in lecture. Doing the code has always helped me learn so I think it would be a good segment to add. 
I have been enjoying the discussion labs.,I feel like the lectures could go into more detail. 
I have enjoyed working on the labs the most. I think that it is fun to problem-solve and apply course concepts together. It is satisfying when the code works as intended.,"I have not liked the length of the assignments and parts of D4 due to some of the instructions being more vague than usual, making it harder."
I enjoyed the walk through instructions and step by step process through data science and manipulation ,Some of the instructions for the lab and assignments were bit confusing and hard to understand what was being expected.
"I have enjoyed the lectures a lot, they are very engaging and professor does an amazing job at explaining everything as well as holding my attention despite it being at 9am. I feel as though the lectures are well paced and structured as well as the examples used are interesting and demonstrate the material we are learning.","I haven't liked the assignments as they have poorly written instructions and I find myself often wondering what I am really being asked to produce or code. In D4, the question, ""Now, take a look at how party breaks down - in other words, calculate how many individuals are in each party in the politics dataset. Store this in party_counts"" is quite confusing because I took this and said ""okay they want it in a dataframe"" so I wrote the code for that only for it not to pass the assert tests because you guys wanted a dictionary. Isn't a dataframe easier to store the information and use later on in the assignment than a dictionary? I just feel like there's a lot of times where you guys can write the instructions to be more specific, and specify what the output should look like."
I enjoy working on the jupyter. It gives me the practices I need to strengthen my knowledge.,I pretty enjoyed everything.
The professor’s understanding approach and helpfulness with her students,Coding isn’t necessarily my favorite thing so sometimes I can get a bit frustrated when I don’t get it right multiple times in a row. But it’s a growth opportunity nonetheless!
I like the lectures and the project. It can help me do the data analysis after this class,Nothing. I like all how this class organized
I enjoyed learning about the different ethical ways data can be obtained and how to analyze the data.,I dont like how datahub is structured because it can be confusing sometimes. Like sometimes the kernal would crash or the page becomes unresponsive or the validation would just give an error and not be able to validate.
Substituting an in-person final exam for a quarter long group project,"As described by my friends previously, I thought this course would be more of an introduction to applying data science skills however the grading scheme along with material being covered seems to go beyond that criteria making me feel very overwhelmed and not confident with this course. "
I have enjoyed working in a group since getting different perspectives is interesting .,I feel like a lof of the work is repetitive.
So far I enjoyed learning GitHub and how to navigate through it. ,"I think the thing that I least enjoyed was also what i enjoyed, it was a bit of a curve navigating through GitHub at first."
Communicating with my team about the project.,When I am getting bugs on assignment coding questions and I cannot figure them out.
"So far, I have enjoyed the data-wrangling labs the most, due to how they allow for a number of ways to accomplish the assigned tasks.","There have not really been any aspects of the class that I have found uninteresting; though, if I had to give an answer, it would be the in-person lab sessions (I just prefer to do the labs at home). However, I do appreciate the fact that you can ask illuminating questions, if you are stumped by a specific part of a lab assignment."
"So far I’ve really enjoyed the lectures, I think they are very informative and very easy to follow even for someone who isn’t the most knowledgeable in data science. I also love the way questions are answered during lecture. ","The labs, I went a couple times and they weren’t very helpful, as a commuter it takes less time to just google stuff up. "
mostly the Quiz it's reasonable and efficient in every way,so far everything is interesting 
The professor is very nice and interactive!,Number of problems on each Assignment. For many of these we do the same data wrangling task over and over again
Data science! This is my first course in data science and the ethics of it has been very interesting thus far. ,"Learning how to use Pandas, numpy and seaborn has been kind of confusing. Even though we're given instructions and notes I still fins myself looking up instructions online. "
I enjoyed process of thinking about a project proposal.,Nothing so far.
"Coding part, I enjoy the coding part because i feel like it is very useful.",the quizzes and reading.
the lectures and their format,the deadlines for the project 
I think I like how the explain that professor use in class. And with some questions that we can all engaged it helps me more focus on the courses materials and learn so new skills.,"I think one assignment per week should be enough. Because if it is more than one assignment per week, a lot of things was not cover in class which makes it very difficult to practice. And if on the homework there is an example question with answer above each questions, it will be very helpful."
The coding assignments,"The names of the assignments, wish it were more clear"
"I have enjoyed the COGS 108 lectures because Professor Ellis does a really great job at explaining complex concepts, especially for me, a person who has not coded in Python since 10th grade.",I have not enjoyed the group project so far because it has been difficult trying to find a time to meet with our entire group. It's also really hard when you are in a group with randomly assigned people.
I liked getting review with git controls and the process of working on the COGS108 project.,Some parts I did find repetitive because I am familiar with some topics.
Learning how important Data is and how it can be used was interesting cause it showcased how much of everything relies on it.,The pace of the class is a bit slow for me cause I already know a lot of the programming concepts being taught but it is understandable since it might not be the same for everyone
"I loved meeting the people in my group! It was nice to see which parts of the project people were best at. For example, the things I did not know another person could pick up.",I did not like having assignments due every single week. It feel like there was no breathing room.
Great professor,Github
"It's a nice review of COGS 9, but with actual implementations! I always forget how to use pandas sometimes, so the pandas slides has been so helpfulf for me during the class and outside of it.","This might sound weird, but the slowed pace is at the beginning. I know I will have to work 2x maybe 3x more in the week than I usually do for COGS 108 because of the project-based class, but the beginning makes me not work as hard for it and then when the project portion comes, I feel unprepared. I don't think this is the class' fault at all; it's just how I work with COGS 108."
What I have enjoyed most about this course so far is how we have been working with Pandas and learning how to import data. Importing data and learning how to analyze it with python has been a bit challenging but I enjoy learning about it. ,I don't have anything that I have least liked about this course so far. Everything has been going well and I am enjoying learning about analyzing data through specific coding. 
Data analysis,Nothing. If I had to answer then it will be how early lectures are. 
I've enjoyed learning more about data science and understanding what can be done with that knowledge. ,I'm not the best at coding and because coding is very tedious is isn't fun at times when you think something is right but it's actually not. 
"I’ve enjoyed applying python with visualization to analyze data, I have not done this prior",N/A - There haven’t been any dislikes the material feels practical 
I enjoy learning the material about data which is the most interesting area for me.,There is no zoom meeting option.
"the coding part, not really know about python, while not focus on it but still give enough info to let people understand and practice.","not really have a problem with it. maybe the group part, hard to communicate with group member in a large course."
I enjoy doing the quizzes because they remine me what I learned in the week.,I dont have any
the lab assignments,the lack of explanation over the coding parts of the class
"I think that the lectures are really engaging, the professor does a good job of explaining what we are learning, how it relates to the project, and using real world examples to help us understand it more. The assignments have also been given out at a reasonable pace.",So far I can't think of any major criticisms with the class.
learning more about how to use data science to analyze data and answer questions about the world,"been pretty good so far, no complaints :) "
"I like that the course is project based because it gives us an opportunity to explore something we are interested in—we can tailor it more to our interests and at the end of the class, have a project that we can add to our portfolio","I would have liked having more time to work with GitHub before using it for the project, like maybe having a GitHub component on some of the assignments, similar to the first assignment, just so I am more familiar with it. Also, if I run into errors, hopefully they would be earlier and in lower stakes assignments"
Learning how to use Pandas because that was new and something I struggled on,"Having to find project ideas, was hard to single one out"
I love the lecture format and how everything is easy explained ,How challenging the assignments are they almost feel impossible 
"I really data visualization lab because while it was challenging, I was able to learn a lot from it. ",I did not like that we did the ethics and data visualization lecture content in halves instead of a smooth continuation of the content but i understand that it was the best arrangement possible for that week's circumstance. 
"I actually enjoy the group aspect of the projects we were given, feels nice to be able to talk to people and collaborate on something that everyone seems passionate about as well as being able to see the different perspectives one may have for the same topic.","Likely due to my limited and not so wide-ranging knowledge of pandas, but man are the discussion assignments tough."
"I most enjoyed the discussion assignments, feel pretty enjoyable and good length ","I dislike the assignments, they feel super drawn out and definitely unnecessarily so. "
I like how well the slides are put together. They're informative but also simplistic. ,Some of the assignments felt quite lengthly. I think it could be shortened while still reinforce the concepts we need to learn
"I love the lectures, you are such a wonderful lecturer",I think the quizzes are annoying to do because they are so subjective.
I like the structure of the labs and assignments I think they are very conducive to learning.  ,N/A
I liked learning about data visualization techniques (using matplotlib)!,"I think some discussion lab assignments have been pretty difficult (especially number 3) and it required a lot of reading up on documentation to understand how to properly pass each test. However, other than that nothing has been unpleasant."
Learning about data filtering and sorting,n/a
What I have enjoyed most about COGS 108 so far is gaining a deeper understanding of data and its practical applications,"So far, there’s nothing I’m dissatisfied with, but having more resources for basic practice coding exercises would make it even better."
I enjoy learning more about data science in our lectures and also being able to work and meet new people in our groups. ,Sometimes the assignments can feel pretty difficult but I understand that working through them furthers my understandings on data science.
"I enjoy the lectures. I like the content, but it is heightened by Prof Ellis' slides and the way she teaches. I like the discussions during the lectures and even filling out and talking about the google forms in between. ","The discussion sessions are not the most helpful. They aren't cohesive and usually don't share slides/ what the discussion was about.
Additionally, I understand the main focus being the group project, however, it is just a little difficult when you do not know many people in the class, hence resulting in a group created through Ed where most people do not contribute/ maintain the enthusiasm they first displayed online. (this is not a criticism of the course directly, since i'm sure there are many groups so they each have good/ bad experiences)"
Group Projects and the creative freedom we are given,A lot of work
I like how hands-on the homeworks are and it helps me to understand how the analysis take place in a straight-forward way. ,I think the instructions on the labs and assignments sometimes are a bit confusing as of what we are asked to do. 
I've enjoyed the the assignments the most. I feel like I learn the most trying to assignments on my own and jupyter notebook makes it so helpful when you can easily visualize your data.,"I feel like it would be more helpful if the discussions were more collaborative. For example, if they showed examples that are similar to the problems we are working on in the discussion assignments on the projector."
"I like how flexible the class is, such as the flexibility with attendance for lecture and lab. We have the choice of whichever time slot best suits our needs. It's also great for group projects.","I find Ed to be a little frustrating to use for course communication. Especially since when trying to check if your question has already been answered through the topic filters, most of the posts are not labeled correctly. I end up having to populate all the posts and filter through them manually."
"Sunday deadlines, gives space to complete early if possible, but alse delay if needed.","Labs sometimes have too much work, it should have the minimum required to know the material for the assignment, or maybe help in the project, not be an assignment itself."
the detailed explanations for why the things we learn in data science are important because it really highlights the application of the class,the group project work and how it is not possible to do during class and makes the class' lecture and class work feel more disconnected 
"Professor Ellis, she is a great lecturer and is great at communicating stuff related to the class and non-related stuff as well! ","Some of the assert tests for discussion assignments have been extreme and unclear, makes  the assignments a little more tedious and hard than they should be."
"Getting more familiar with data wrangling and pandas operations. I also really liked learning about the different statistical tests I could use to learn more about my data--I kinda fell into data science and this is the first class that I took that formalizes a lot of what I've done before, and a gap in toolkit has always been the statistics part. Also, the flow chart of defining what kind of data science projects we could do was great! I think letting us know key terms we can look up on our own to optionally deepen our knowledge is great.",n/a
I enjoyed looking at previous projects the most. ,I think it would be the discussion questions. 
I have enjoyed the coding labs. I find them very interesting and love to learn about other statistics while coding.,I have least liked trying to learn github. I have found the platform difficult and just confusing overall to use
Learning to be a great data analyst,Nothing
"I really like the lectures, they are engaging and very interesting. I like the example illustrated in the lecture. The labs are interesting since we get to work with actual data sets and get to interpret them at the end and also search and learn some new stuff when completing the lab.  ",This not a dislike but overall maybe too broad so spend little time in each time. I feel like we go from a topic to another very quickly which is reasonable due to nature of the course and time constraints we have. 
I enjoy the way the class is structured. It is very convienient to know everything is due on the same day.,"I wish we could go over how github works more in detail especially because we are all at different levels, and sometimes I feel like I am a burden for my group since they know a lot more than I do."
I really enjoy the format of having projects instead of exams. ,"I'm not really a big fan having to go to like 4 different plaforms to keep updated: canvas, ed, github, datahub"
"I enjoy the practical nature of the class, and the freedom given to the students to explore something they are interested in.","In one of the labs, one of the instructions was unclear and I spent way too long trying to understand what it is the lab wanted me to do."
I enjoy the fact that my level of understanding the topics in this course has increased this time around. (It's still challenging though!),"It's not what I like least about the course per se but what I like least about data science/programming/computer work in general: that it is time consuming, tedious, and I sit for long periods of time in front of a screen which is perhaps my least favorite thing to do in life. I just don't like staring at screens (it's one of the reasons why I don't use/like social media). "
"I liked the assignments so far, they make me feel like I am able to use the knowledge from the course for something.","For me, I think the sections have felt kind of useless for me."
Working in with my group on the project because it has allowed me to connect with some new people, The assignments because they are time consuming
The content in this class is fundamental and interesting to my career goals. ,"I found the concepts easier to digest, but hard to execute them and do coding on python. "
I enjoyed having mostly review for the first couple weeks of lecture like with Github repositories and how they work. I actually like the lectures overall as they’re easy to follow.,The fact that this is a group project based class means having to reach out to other classmates. It’s difficult trying to adjust to how other people like to do things and have to spend time to come up either with some middle ground or just go with what the majority says. It’s anxiety inducing sometimes.
The ability to complete the course asynchronously.,Quizzes seem a little unnecessary. 
Lectures introducing data science,Weekly Discussion and Assignments having lot of overlapping parts
I have enjoyed diving into the assignments and really understanding how to generate plots and represent my data with things like seaborn and matplotlib.,"I have least enjoyed troubleshooting errors and debugging my code, but even then, I liked finally figuring out where I went wrong and how to fix the issues."
I like the datahub system it keeps machine learning stuff very organized and I am not required to run it on my own computer or even with colab,The assignments feel at time tedious and a bit like busy work
The team project.,The assignment sometimes were too complicated
I quite like it as a systematic review of many of the data science tools I've used before.,Nothing in particular
Engaging assignments with instant feedback and a lot of useful information,I don't have anything in mind that I dislike 
"I personally enjoy the group project. It's fun working in a collaborative environment for me, since I get to here other people's inputs and learn from them.","While I do like the lectures, I personally dislike having to attend them in person since I have to commute to school. Otherwise, there's barely anything I'm dissatisfied with. I think making the course hybrid would be beneficial for commuters."
easy assignments :) ,the quizzes. dont like them at all
One thing I like the most about COGS 108 is that the lectures are podcasted. This makes it very easy to go back and rewatch a concept or topic I wasn't quite sure about after class ends.,One thing I like the least about COGS 108 is the assignments being due on Sunday night. I think if they were due on Friday it would be more helpful so we don't end up working on most of it during the weekend.
I liked the fermi estimations exercise as it shows how we're not the best with estimating or even grappling with the magnitudes of numbers. And hence showing a real need for data visualisation and analysis.,"The discussion sections, went to one and didn't feel a need to go again."
Flexible Schedule,N/A
I have enjoyed the lectures the most about COGS 108. The professor is very engaging and explains things in a manner that makes it easy to remember.,"My least favorite thing about COGS 108 so far is the layout of the class information. Sometimes, it feels like things are hard to find and I think having a website over a github repository would help with that."
"I enjoyed seeing the guest lectures, along with the real life application that we've talked about in class. ",Some of the assignments I feel unprepared even after class. 
"I really like the Github page, it's really organzied",The pace is fast and a lot of self study need to be done for people not familiar with python
The thing I've enjoyed most about this class is the flexibility. I really like how the professor allows us to attend whichever lecture we want and I really appreciate that as someone who has a really busy and spontaneous schedule.,"The thing I've like least about COGS 108 so far is that sometimes it feels like the tutorial on how to use github/jupyterhub is confusing. However, I know that I can figure it out by asking peers or TAs."
"So far, I've enjoyed the assignment sections (A1, A2, etc.) of the course as they've so far been pretty guiding towards how to use pandas, seaborn, etc. in python. I feel like they're a major part in helping me understand and properly implement code for analyzing and cleaning survey data.","I don't have many dislikes in the class but to be nitpicky, I would have to say that I dislike the discussion assignments as they tend to have some vague instructions at times where I end up lost. "
Finding a project that the whole team enjoys. It felt very collaborative,"the assignments. I feel that for me, these assignments are a bit redundant for my prior experience but I understand that not everyone has the same background as I have."
The team aspect of the project!,N/A
I have enjoyed writing code and seeing the results myself in Assignments and Discussion Labs so far.,I have liked least the group project so far because I prefer individual working. 
I liked how most of the questions or examples used in lecture is real data/real life scenarios.,"Lab assignments are sometimes lengthy for the amount of points they are worth, but not such a big deal as they are doable."
So far I've really enjoyed learning about pandas! I've never used python for analyzing data so it's been fun creating visualizations in our assignments.,N/A
"The group stuff are pretty fun. They're decently laid back, and I got to know new people.","The assignments, I guess. They're hardly 'unlikable', but compared to the other materials, I generally dislike any form of assignment with hidden tests or such. If I did something wrong, I'd prefer if I get some form of feedback."
"the content! i find it very interesting, and at this point in my college experience i have not had many classes where i see things implemented in the real world.","the python assignments. they're honestly okay, but it can be a bit hard to parse through everything because it's all just text. maybe some more visual space would help make things more digestible!"
"the lectures! quite interesting and as a business major, cogs isn't in my career path fully but i feel that i have been learning something new. ",the group project. One of the member has been trying to take control and in the process has confused the rest of the group regarding the guidelines of the project. 
"What I have enjoyed the most about the class is the way we focus on one project that I can put in my link, which gives me some experience with these types of projects. As well I feel like with the other assignments it's making me understand python as I go through the assignments and discussions
","Honestly, I have been struggling a lot with the assignments that we have like A1, A2, etc. Honestly, the rest of the class is designed especially for this course type of course learning as we progress through the course and project."
Content of lectures and opportunity to work on a project of our choice,"I wish the due dates were a bit more spread out. For instance, having all programming assignments, discussion assignments, and other project-related tasks due on Sunday can feel a bit overwhelming. However, I do appreciate that we’re given late days if needed."
The lectures,I struggle with the coding assignments
"I enjoy the practical aspect of the learned material in this course. The professor not only covers the skills required to process and analyze data, but also investigates the ethical and moral implications of personal data and data analysis. ","So far, the thing that I have liked least about COGS 108 are the discussion labs. While they do somewhat help for the assignments, I feel that the connection is not as clear or intuitive as it should be."
I enjoy the structure of the lectures. Think/Pair/Share is a nice interactive part of lectures and it's really helped me learn more about data science and apply these skills towards the project. ,Honestly the quizzes are annoying.
"Assignments and ""discussion"" assigments are very straight forward with adequate amount of time to complete each one. Everything being due on the same day every weeks helps with my work flow.",I wish the lecture slides would be divided into days instead of per week so that it would be easier to keep track of the content.
I really like the interactive lecture attendance quizzes that make me reflect and think about the content.,"I haven't liked the repetitive nature of the discussion assignments sometimes, and would wish they were more concise."
I really like how the class is based. The idea of having a final project we get to work on throughout the quarter is honestly a really cool concept. I think doing that and spending time working on a meaningful project that can also be put on my resume at the end of the class is great. ,"I think maybe there could be a better way to choose groups when it comes to the final project due for this class. I think I got lucky with my group but I was honestly a little stressed at first since I didn't really know anyone coming into this class and wasn't sure if using Ed was going to be helpful in me actually finding a group. I know it's a really big class so the way we did it was probably the best way, but maybe there are alternatives in helping distribute people in groups based on potential topics of interest. "
I have enjoyed learning how to use Python to create visualizations for data. I like to try the different matplotlib plots and seeing how different plots can communicate different things.,I would like if we went over a bit more of the coding aspect in class.
I have enjoyed listening to lectures the most. It has been really interesting doing the quiz questions in class and learning about all the different topics.,"I have least liked doing the assignments as I feel I cannot find the right guidance and resources to do them. During discussion, most people are confused, and peers are also confused when I ask questions outside of class."
Expanding my familiarity with python (which was a language I had no experience in before) as I feel like I'm investing time into the development of a skill that will help me in a lot of different contexts in the future.,I missed about a week of instruction because I was sick and I still feel like I'm having to run to catch up with material so that I understand assignments when they are due.
"the skills about data cleaning, analysis are really useful",:)
I have enjoyed being able to actually practice coding in use as opposed to other coding classes I have taken,"I think having multiple assignments due on the same day makes it slightly hard as other classes I am taking at the same time do the same, giving me many assignments due on a single day. "
"I enjoyed the lab assignments (D series) the most in COGS 108. It led me to learning more about data science the most, and also helped me learn practical application of it.","I have liked the lecture portion of COGS 108 the least. I feel that although it is engaging and interesting, I find it a little difficult to learn enough from them and often have to research a lot on my own."
I think just begin able to see what students were able to do in past projects has been really cool through that one activity. Also just being able to see the cool things one can do with data through the examples in lecture -- like how this google form can be analyzed -- has been super cool. Being able to inch my skills closer and closer to that has been something that I think is really cool.,"I think it has been difficult for me to be working in a larger group and getting to know them. Making sure we are up to date with everything that we have to do has been kind of difficult, but it is not something that I would say that I dislike, it's just something I am not used to."
The group project and research have been interesting.,Weekly quizzes but I just forgot them often.
I really enjoyed learning how to use jupyter notebook especially working with data frames and data visualizations.,"Personally, what I least liked so far was doing D3 since it felt like the difficulty just jumped compared to the two discussions before it."
I have enjoyed the coding assignments. I find coding to be a sort of puzzle that I can try to figure out.,I have not liked the 9am class time. I could not sign up for the later time and I do find that my focus is not as good that early in the morning.
Group work,"Nothing, all good :)"
I like the discussion where we are able to practice the different package within Python. ,I think each week there is many assignments that we have to finish so the class takes up some time to do. But I would agree we are able to better understand the material. 
I have enjoyed doing the assignments and labs. I enjoy working with pandas and python.,"There has been a bit of a learning curve with using Seaborn, so I would say that's what I've liked the least."
I enjoyed the guest lectures. I enjoyed the different perspectives and reassurance these professionals advised from various backgrounds. I also enjoy how every assignment is due on Sunday.,I don't particular enjoy the lecture quiz since I don't really gain much from it.
"I have enjoyed attending the lectures and working through examples to learn how to utilize python (specifically pandas) to process and work with data, it has been really interesting to learn about and to work with it hands on. The lectures help lay a nice foundation for taking on the parts of the course we need to do on our own, so it's quite enjoyable to go to lecture and gain that understanding.","Some of the assignments have been a little bit difficult at times, it can be annoying to run into a problem that you don't know how to solve. But I can't really say that there is anything I've strongly disliked so far in this class, I've mostly enjoyed and been content with the work load and the content in this class. I guess GitHub was a little bit tricky to figure out and feels a little bit tougher to do, but it is interesting and undoubtably useful. "
The assignments are very interesting because they have real life applications. I can see the real world effects of the skills we gain from these assignments.,The assignments are difficult and very time-consuming. 
working on the project. I like that we have the freedom to work on a project topic we actually enjoy. ,"the number of deadline, we really need to stay on top of all the work."
"I really enjoyed the lectures about data visualization. It was cool to see the various ways of plotting data, and the interesting insights that can be drawn from these plots.","I haven't really liked the slow pace of the class. For example, we're more than half way through the quarter and haven't written any code for the project."
"One thing I have enjoyed the most about COGS 108 so far is the collaboration aspect of it. While we are just kickstarting the project, being given full creative freedom over our projects is something that I enjoy.","The assignments are manageable but it is very heavy in terms of content. A lot of the content is very much words and text, and as a visual learner, I would like to see more things like that. "
"I enjoyed learning about the different dataset visualizations and being able to better understand what it takes to make changes to a project on Github, while working in a team. ",The challenges faced when trying to understand Github. I still struggle with committing the changes in the proper format to not disturb the flow of the work. 
"I loved learning the way data is collected and how it is used. Especially on how its made into these beautiful graphs. Visual data is beautiful data, and being able to learn how to do that is great.","I don't really like the coding aspect of this class, as I myself don't really like coding. Even with coming from a python class, it's still hard to navigate and learn all this seaborn and pandas material."
i have enjoyed learning about the fundamentals of data science and the most basic applications of them to real life. it gives real meaning to the subject and how it can be utilized in day-to-day life.,I have not enjoyed review too much since I have taken DSC10 and a lot of the topics are review from both courses.
"I like the process of brainstorming data science topic, also deal with dataframes use pandas","I think some of the assignment's writeup are not super clear, therefore I have to spend some time on reading them and make sure I did the right thing through the working process."
"The hands-on, practical approach to data science. Unlike theory-heavy courses, this class emphasizes implementation and experimentation, which aligns well with how data science is applied in the real world. I appreciate the focus on trying different methods, making mistakes, and learning from them, as this mirrors the trial-and-error process of real data work.

Additionally, I find the group project component particularly exciting. Collaborating with others to tackle a real-world data problem encourages teamwork, communication, and problem-solving—essential skills for a data scientist. The emphasis on exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and ethical considerations also makes the course comprehensive and engaging.

The flexibility in lecture attendance, the structured yet adaptable schedule, and the inclusion of discussion sections for additional support are all aspects that enhance the learning experience. Overall, the balance between guided learning and independent problem-solving makes this course both challenging and rewarding.","So far, what I have liked least about COGS 108 is the weekly quizzes with a single, timed attempt. While I understand the goal of reinforcing lecture material, the 15-minute limit can feel a bit rushed, especially when trying to carefully read and think through each question. Given that the quizzes are open-notes, I think a slightly longer time frame would allow for a better balance between testing knowledge and reducing unnecessary pressure.

Additionally, the group project structure, while valuable, can be challenging when it comes to coordinating with teammates. Since everyone has different schedules and work styles, ensuring equal participation and meeting deadlines requires extra effort. It would be helpful to have more structured check-ins or built-in mechanisms to address team dynamics early on."
I have enjoyed being able to use the code in the jupyter notebooks to follow along with lectures as it really helps me understand and learn what the code does during the lecture.,"I dislike having unclear instructions in the notebooks, which confuse me on what each cell should contain. For example, in D4 there was a part where you have to make a year column for the politics Dataframe and put that code in the cell. The markdown text before that cell also says to make a plot with the x-axis being changed to 'year' instead of 'congress' and to categorize the lines on the graph by party. I interpreted this information as having to put the code for adding the year column and the code to plot a graph showing the age over time with different parties in the same cell. This lead to my confusion when there was another coding cell with text that tells me to change the x-axis from 'congress' to 'year'; and another cell that told me to show age over time by party. It left me questioning what code to I put in each cell."
The labs on datahub are interactive and fun to figure out.,"Too many things to keep track of, also datahub is hard to sort through once there are many assignments."
Being able to work with real data through the lectures and hws.,Datahub freezing or stuttering is the worst part. I have to constantly kill the kernel and rerun everything which is not frequent in my local environment.
The engaging lecture style and being in a class with my friends.,N/A
"Easy-to-follow lectures, real-world examples of concepts taught in class.","Repeat info of what I've learned before, but that's just a personal thing. Good to review knowledge, though."
"Discussion section, There are very helpful to work on Labs and Assignments and even project with your team","Everything is due on Sunday, and sunday is my recovery day"
I’ve enjoyed the flexibility of lecture times ,NA
Group project: I like how we are all taking our project seriously and working on it together. ,I wish the class has an online option without missing out on attendance.
I enjoy the Discussions and Assignments because the way they're formatted is very easy to follow and helps me actively learn and practice the content.,"This is more of a personal issue, but I've learned a lot of Python material similar to the things we've been doing in COGS 108 in previous courses, so most assignments are more like refreshers to me than learning new content."
"What I enjoyed most was that this course closely combined data science with practical applications, which helped me better understand the course. In the process, I learned to use Python programming and data analysis. And my collaboration with other team members helped me learn better through teamwork.","I think the most challenge is that the workload and pace of the course are a bit fast, and sometimes I need to spend some time writing and debug."
I have enjoyed accessibility of the tutors/tas/prof,There is nothing that I have actively disliked so far
Learning new things. Pretty cool to see some things that I did not know before.,"Jupyter notebook is kinda weird, but that's probably because I never used it before"
Yes. The course is very structured and the materials provided are helpful. But the workload can be a bit stressful.,The workload can be stressful sometimes.
"I enjoyed the lectures and the structure of the class, which allows us to explore and learn a lot about data science and how to effectively work and manipulate data.","I think that overall, the course has been great as it is, and I think that it might be useful to incorporate more live coding and tips for working in pandas in class, as it can sometimes get a little confusing about with the different functions and how to effectively use them."
I have enjoyed the group projects the most. Being able to work together on a big coding project and doing on something that we have a common passion on is very nice.,I have least liked some of the datahub questions as some of them had some weird errors that were hard to debug.
Learning different data science technologies that will be useful in the industry.,The labs. They're a bit tedious.
I think i enjoyed learning about how to find and manipulate data. I think learning applicable skills for the real world allows me to boost my resume and widen my skillset. Taking classes like these feel most beneficial to my future and career.,"I think i liked the quizs the least, however they play a very small role in the my grade overall. It feels like more of a hassle more than anything, however I can see the purpose behind it."
Doing the project,Inactive group members
The assignments ,Nothing 
"I have enjoyed getting to really understand how to use the python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) on analyzing data. I've heard of these libraries many times before but never got to try them out myself. I think these are very powerful tools that can be used effectively for analyzing and visualizing data.","So far, I least liked having to go to class at 9am, which is why I often skip class and just look at the podcast. I know this is my fault and not the course, but this is the only thing I can think of :)."
"I really like how the workload in this course is structured. Having multiple styles of assignments, quizzes, assignments, labs. I appreciate how assignments are every other week. I also enjoy how interactive the lectures are, the qr codes allow me to think about the information being presented. ","I feel that there isn't much time in the lecture speaking about the projects and what is expected from us in detail. I understand that it is to allow students to be creative and have free reigns, but for those who are newer to data science, it is a bit overwhelming. Sometimes, I do not know which data science methods to use, especially.  "
I enjoy the engaging lecture and how creative the projects can be! Leaves a lot of room for creativity and it's not a linear!,Workload can be a bit much from time to time. Weekly assignments can be quite overwhelming. 
I have enjoyed most about the lecture content of COGS 108 the most. I think the lectures conveys information in a very comprehensive way that makes me learn a lot about data science and coding. I also like how the lectures also include other non-coding aspect of data science such as ethics that make me gain a more complete picture of data science.,"I have liked least about the amount homework due each week. For some of the weeks, an assignment, a lab, and a quiz is due on same week, which is a lot of loading for computational homework for a week (especially for a person not familiar with Github and coding)."
I have enjoyed the engaging lectures,I dislike coding a lot
The fact that is is practical and we have alots of choise for the group project. ,How we dive right into python and it's been pretty hard to do the assignments.
Manipulating data,"setting up, we had GitHub lectures for over a week which I think was a waste of time"
"I like the collaborative process in COGS 108. I've never used GitHub before in this way, so pushing and pulling changes in the repositories while communicating with your teammates feels very new and productive to me. It's fun to do so.","I don't like how non-beginner friendly COGS 108 is in regards to GitHub. I think the lectures did help a bit, but for the initial assignment, I had to search up tutorials on how to do a lot of things. I also was very unaware of most of the vocabulary and how to set up ""git bash"", so I had to do my own research."
"The way you explain things so well, the way you encourage discussion and participation, and the way you organize class!","Probably the fact that I have to get used to the Python syntax, because it feels frustrating to have to learn to speak a language even when I know what I want to do conceptually. "
"I enjoy the lectures and the topics discussed, they're very interesting and engaging, and the exercises are fun","The discussions do not feel very productive. Though it's only really 10 minutes of the TA talking, it still feels like there could be more than just what was discussed in the previous lectures"
I have enjoyed data visualization the most because I love how informative and insightful visuals can be. It’s fascinating to see how different visualization techniques can reveal trends and patterns that might not be immediately obvious in raw data.,"Nothing so far,  the class has been really fun. Prof Ellis teaches really well and her in class quizzes are cool."
I've enjoyed having so much time to think about the project and set up a strong systematic approach.,Some of discussion/assignments being too harsh in the assert or not clear in the question has been annoying.
"Learning about data analysis techniques and being able to apply them to a hands-on, self-developed project","The problem descriptions on some assignments can be vague at times. For example, I found myself initially lost as to how the graphs were meant to look on the data visualization assignment, and it took a bit of guesswork to infer whether my plotted graph matched expectations based on the problem description"
I've enjoyed working with my team because it's exciting to meet new people and work on something we're all interested in.,The assignments have been a little difficult.
"Learning about ethics and privacy of the dataset. I feel like it is often neglected, or looked over but taking time to review the ethics and privacy of data handling has been interesting",Team work has been a bit stressful - it is hard to gather everyone.
"Guest Lecture - Fun to hear from practicing data scientists in industry and the mindset to thrive in the environment.

Group Project - Great teammates, opportunity to explore our own interests through a data science lens.",N/A
Labs. Learn a lot,The ability to skip lecture. Lecture should be mandatory.
I enjoyed the flexibility of late days for homework,jupyter notebook file sometimes get corrupted 
I enjoy how the homework walks us through how to do each step and why we are doing it. I think things like this help me learn the most by making me figure it out myself and actively look out for which functions to use at what times.,"The quizzes can be stressful at times because of the short time limit, but it overall isn't too bad. "
I have enjoyed the ability to meet new people through this project oriented class.,I don't like how the assignments and discussion work is on a separate portal. It's just a personal preference on how I am use to coding.
I enjoyed learning about code so far in COGS 108.,I least liked going to lecture because my lectures are the early ones.
"I have enjoyed the structure of the class overall. Professor Ellis's lectures are engaging, especially as someone who was not very familiar with data science before this class. I particularly like the Google Form questions during lecture because they help check my understanding. ","Some of the questions on the weekly quizzes have seemed either vague, or I don't believe they were emphasized/covered in class enough to warrant being on the quizzes. "
Learning about Machine Learning!,Nothing
"One of the most fascinating things that ive learned in cogs was being able to condense such information dense topics into small graphs, like the recent discussion 4. This would be able to help developers decipher information faster than trying to read through an article/numbers",One of the things that has been frustrating was adapting to the trial and error of coding. The endless errors can be a struggle but once a code works it’s really nice and satisfying since it is your own code.
Project,Hard to attend every lecture
Just learning about the data science in general. I've always wanted to try and using datasets from Kaggle but haven't got to.,"Jupyter is cool and interesting, but it is sometimes laggy and hard to use."
"My favorite part is the weekly assignments on jupyter. Even though I am not a huge fan of coding, seeing my code go through without any errors is pretty satisfying and fun. ",I am not a big fan of coding so just some general unhappiness with how much we have code. 
I’ve enjoyed the pacing and straightforward lecture style. The slides and visuals are very helpful.,I’m still getting used to github so that learning curve has been the most difficult 
I've enjoyed refreshing myself with Python and working with my group on our project.,Discussion 3 was surprisingly difficult.
Learning about a whole new field. As a bio/neuroscience major it’s cool to add new tools to my skillset. ,Probably the difficulty. For me it’s like a blurred language I’m trying to learn. It’s cool to learn but gets frustrating along the way 
"I've enjoyed the organization of the class. Specifically, I have liked the variety of course work from labs, assignments, lecture notes, GitHub to quizzes. It helps me learn when I have multiple sources of learning rather than just lectures and coding. I like moving between platforms, keeps my mind engaged when I can shift through various tasks.",Having a couple of unmotivated students in my group has made the project a tad more labor intensive than I'd prefer. Hoping that will change as expectations are communicated.
"I enjoyed the lectures and the way she explains certain concepts with the tone of her voice, it doesn't sound monotone, and makes the content interesting. ",I have liked the least is how general the projects are without going to office hours. Maybe including a video outline x y and z and what a highly graded project would look like. 
Selecting peers for the group project is comforting. I also enjoyed learning about different graphs and their purposes.,I feel like the final project concepts and process could be emphasized more during lecture. A more week to week guide would be appreciated.
"The discussion assignments, I think they cover a lot and are really helpful","assignment length sometimes, but this really isn't an issue"
being able to code a program that creates  graph or form of data visualization,navigating github can be a bit tricky
Working with data and writing code to analyze the data,feels a little unstructured/not enough guidance on some homework assignments
"Yes, it has been pretty interesting","The coding, only because it can be pretty complicated at times."
"I have enjoyed the lectures and found it very interesting, engaging, and interactive. ",The group project can be a bit challenging for me because I am still new to Github/coding and found it challenging to work and communicate with my team at some points. 
"I really like the engagement, especially with the quizzes that we take during the class (and how it reveals the score, which while it is not for credit, makes them really fun to take!!). I also think that everyone has been really helpful, especially when asking questions over discussion and on EdStem!","My least favorite aspect is how we have some weeks where we have a bunch of assignments all due on the same day, usually a mixture of a lab, assignment, quiz, or something project related. This can sometimes get overwhelming, especially when we need to make sure that we have turned everything due that day. But I think it can be manageable if we do the work earlier, especially on assignments as they get released for a good amount of time before needing to turn them in. I also think slip days help with the amount! "
"class vibes, feels interactive",myself because i struggle whhen i fall behind
"I like applying coding concepts to real-world examples. It feels like I am seeing how it can be used in a career/research, which is exciting!","Because my coding background is just COGS18, I feel kind of lost in my understanding of proper syntax/pandas concepts. I have a good grasp of python fundamentals, but troubleshooting is really difficult when concepts are applied to the labs/assignments."
Looking at different ways of interpretating the data.,Coding
I enjoy the assignments and the vast amount of visual representation tools that we are using. They are very useful for the future and toward my current personal/career projects.,"As much as I like the assignments, with all the different aspects of the course it can seem a little daunting at times. Perhaps making the Discussion assignments optional would help, however they don't make the course too too difficult. "
"Lectures have been easy to watch as it is hard for me to commute often, but the accessibility to watching lectures online makes it easier for me to be able to keep up with the curriculum",i think everything is working fine atm. 
Group Project,Some lectures felt unnecessary
"I've most enjoyed learning about how to properly use EDA and pandas data wrangling. This is due to the fact that I want to be in the data science/ML field for my career, and as such, need to know how to properly use data and prepare it for projects I may need in the future. ","I've probably least liked the section of the course on python review. I know it was necessary for students who may have needed it, but felt boring when I've already done python programming for awhile. "
I've been enjoying reviewing python and learning more about Pandas compared to COGS 18. I hope we can work with more data sets and get more practice so I don't have to google things as often:),"The part I liked the least so far was how quickly we went through seaborn. I would like more practice with that, since we just had the one discussion lab where it was pretty intense and then the assignment was some matplotlib. I feel like I will be able to figure it out for the group project, but I wish we could have spent more time on it."
"I've enjoyed all the practice with python, it has felt very useful and important to my learning not just as a data scientist but a 21st century student","I've not liked that this class is a group project, I've had a lot of bad experiences with group projects that have made me generally not like them."
I've really enjoyed the pace and attention to detail in the lectures. Its obvious Prof Ellis has a clear understanding of how she wants to go over the course material and it reflects the quiz material and project really well.,I wish we'd go over the project a little more. The structure of learning new information and keeping up with the assignments and the project can be a little overwhelming for just one class.
"I think the most enjoyable part of COGS 108 so far is the manipulation of the data. While it's quite difficult, I think it's really cool to see how it all works.",I think the part I've liked least is how much prior knowledge we need for this class. It's not super clear and my group and I are having a hard time figuring a lot of things out. It would be nice to know when something is new information and when something is expected prior knowledge so we know when we should already know something or not. Otherwise we just feel a bit crazy not knowing how something works.
"I've enjoyed doing more python. During COGS18, I enjoyed getting to understand python. Though it's more difficult now in this upper division class,  I still enjoy getting to understand and be more knowledgeable about what I could do with python even if it's more based on data science.","Although GitHub is a huge part of this class, I don't enjoy it as much. I think that it's quite difficult to understand even the basic parts of it. I don't really understand it as much, even if I tried to watch a few videos on it, which makes it more difficult to do."
I really enjoyed that this course involves group work because it allows for me to step out of my comfort zone a bit.,I would say what I would like least is the time management with this course as it is rigorous and can be difficult to manage the hard deadlines.
Graphs,How hard its getting
"I've really enjoyed the in class polls, I believe it keeps everyone in lecture really engaged, and it's really interesting to see the data from everyone in the class.","It has been difficult to complete all the homework for one night, being Sunday at 11:59pm. Especially now that group work is beginning to be due."
I have liked the assignments and discussion assignments because they are practical and work in the real world ,Fixing the code and not knowing what the problem is 
I like that this class has an organized schedule and presentations. There are times were I have an increasingly hard time understanding concepts when the slides and lecture notes aren't clear or organized but I haven't had that problem in this class. And it's easy to miss assignments when the set schedule keeps changing so i'm glad we're on track in this class.,Assignment instructions. Sometime the instructions make it harder to complete the assignments because of its unclear wording.
I like the discussions because of how interactive they are ,Probably the assignments only because I tend to struggle more on them. 
Learning about github,learning to use github
I've enjoyed working on coding assignments and learning how to process and analyze data.,Using GitHub has been a struggle for me and complicated.
"What I have enjoyed the most thus far is learning how to properly display a data set. Whilst I still have a very trivial understanding of what is considered to be a good display vs a bad one, it has been interesting as I personally believe I am a creative individual so having the opportunity to take something like numbers and be able to mold them into different digestible shapes and colors has been a lot of fun.","Definitely the coding. I know that it's a predominant part of the class, but holy moly, can it be tedious at times. I still struggle to understand what it is I am doing with a lot of aspects of the coding portion of the class, but I'm trying my best to keep up."
yes. I enjoy leaning what’s needed in order to make a good analysis of a data set. It is very practical.,Sometimes the in-class quiz for extra credit closed too soon. It just closed after I make my decision after a hesitation.
"I enjoy all the data exploration we have done so far. I think the data we work with is interesting, fun, and informative",I hate how scared and anxious I am about the data science project. I wish there was more encouragement and communication with TAs this late into the quarter. I still don't know which TA is my grader.
I like my team and how we work and get along with each other,"N/A, I don't have anything I like least about COGS 108."
"I enjoyed the discussion labs, they taught me a lot of useful skills in Pandas",doing assignments (they take so long :( )
"As someone who doesn't know much about data science, I am enjoying learning about how it's real life applications. I'm also enjoying coding on jupyter notebook too -- working on code and have it finally work is a really fun feeling. ","Although I understand that the goal of the class is to execute a project that I can put on my resume, show off to employers, etc., but I like the group project aspect the least. Group projects are stressful for me because everyone has different goals in classes. I also have run into lots of problems with github/ using the Terminal on my computer, so that has also been a source of stress for me. "
Coding assignments are fun,Some of the assignments have buggy parts to them
Doing the coding assignments and learning new Python.,Getting confused when I don't know how to solve something for the coding assignments and spending time to figure it out.
I have enjoyed looking at relevant information and correlating it to the work in class. I haven't done too much stuff regarding data science and coding so I enjoy this!,"I think it was stressful finding a group and coordinating meeting times, but as we get further into the quarter it has gotten better. "
Get to do Python again,Nothing much
How I get to team with people to work in a project,a few of lab assignments were repetitive
The assignments. I enjoy working with dataframes in python.,Project. I am not a fan of writing descriptions.
I really enjoyed the Fermi estimation questions. I feel like the engage me the most during lectures,Probably the fact the too many assignments are due on the same date. I think that they should be spread out.
