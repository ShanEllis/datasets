I would also have liked to possibly expanded more on missing data and how to deal with that. The third assignment deals with Beautiful Soup and web scraping a bit, but I feel like it wasn't covered as much as it should have.

It's too independent; taking only one python introductory class and having actual projects given my whole group feels lost. A2 took me a week while some CS students took 5 minutes to complete. I had to google 90% of the codes A2 was asking for. It was just to complete at one point and submit. Working in a group made me realize some people know more about coding while others don't have experience at all and that leaves the workload on mostly the ones who know coding the most or have the most leadership skills. ,0,sp19

I think this is great in terms of office hours, but as an entire section seems to be pointless. Especially for those who are generally confused with the course. There is no form of recap or discussion occurring in these sections. ",0,sp19
I most i dont like about cogs 108 so far is not having the option of choosing own teammate.

"If we can get more instructions and information about the final project during discussion sessions/outside of class, such as a project lab session might help a lot on pushing the group project to be done with the right direction.

To give a specific example from today's lecture(2/18/20), on the podcast from 9:35-10:12, the slide involves the linear regression from our last lecture. I feel like there's not much to say about our linear equation, and a simply structured sentence about how last time we fit our data to a line would suffice to cover this concept.",0,wi20

"I don't like the ambiguity of the assignments. They covers a large portion of the grade, which requires a prefect score to get a good final grade and costly to even miss a single question. For example in A3 there's a question asking about ""By looking at the plot you just generated, approximately how many people in df do the data suggest took no steps?"" The figure shows about 1000 people in the bin near 0, however, by a closer look, the data is actually -1, which often indicates missing data. There's a contradiction between instruction and question.",0,wi20

"Although the assignments are not difficult, there's too few tolerance for faults. A small mistake can cause a significant deduction in the overall grade, and causes a lot of stress on the student. I prefer more difficult assignments with lenient grading that tests the student's knowledge of the course materials rather than whether the student is careful or not. Also, the assignment should focus more on data analysis as a data scientist, and less on some minor details of pandas and python. It would be much less stressful for the student when they know that their grade was deducted because they did not master the material than if it's because they were not careful enough when doing the homework.",0,wi20
