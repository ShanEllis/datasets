It's too independent; taking only one python introductory class and having actual projects given my whole group feels lost. A2 took me a week while some CS students took 5 minutes to complete. I had to google 90% of the codes A2 was asking for. It was just to complete at one point and submit. Working in a group made me realize some people know more about coding while others don't have experience at all and that leaves the workload on mostly the ones who know coding the most or have the most leadership skills.,0,sp19

"I really do not like the discussion sections. I want to emphasize this a lot because I have gone to multiple sections whether it is a TA or IA. All of them seem pointless to attend due to the lack of help you can receive in them. The procedure at these discussions is everyone simply sitting down, and the TA/IA waits until an individual has a question on their assignment. I think this is great in terms of office hours, but as an entire section seems to be pointless. Especially for those who are generally confused with the course. There is no form of recap or discussion occurring in these sections. ",0,sp19
I most i dont like about cogs 108 so far is not having the option of choosing own teammate.

Sometimes it may easily get lost since it's a first data science project for some of the students, and we cannot do it very efficiently by spending time exploring everything ourselves.",0,wi20
I get points deducted on homework even when the answers make sense,0,wi20
Meeting up with project group can be a struggle since the group has many people.,0,wi20
"I feel like the lectures could be more concise(in terms of number of words said and spacing between words, not in terms of time) (Hemingway's Iceberg Theory). 

To give a specific example from today's lecture(2/18/20), on the podcast from 9:35-10:12, the slide involves the linear regression from our last lecture. I feel like there's not much to say about our linear equation, and a simply structured sentence about how last time we fit our data to a line would suffice to cover this concept.",0,wi20
Quizzes taking place of attendance,0,wi20
Principles that needs to remember,0,wi20
"I don't like the ambiguity of the assignments. They covers a large portion of the grade, which requires a prefect score to get a good final grade and costly to even miss a single question. For example in A3 there's a question asking about ""By looking at the plot you just generated, approximately how many people in df do the data suggest took no steps?"" The figure shows about 1000 people in the bin near 0, however, by a closer look, the data is actually -1, which often indicates missing data. There's a contradiction between instruction and question.",0,wi20

The early lecture times,0,wi20
Probably waking up so early for the class but that's more of a personal choice. I think overall the topics are interesting and all the topics taught are helpful for our project which is great.,0,wi20
Having to do wake up at 8am. Its to early of a class.,0,wi20
discussion section isn't that helpful,0,wi20
The HW has hidden test cases and sometimes they don't pass,0,wi20
"Googling documentation of some python functions, there are so many versions of the python and because I am new to python, I have to look up syntax for most of the assignments.",0,wi20
Sometimes assignments are somewhat trivial. But I'm biased since im a computer science major.,0,wi20
Finding groups was a bit stressful. I would have liked an option to get auto-paired up in a team.,0,wi20
Sometimes the questions in assignments are unclear.,0,wi20
"Waking up before 7am. It has been an adjustment, but I've been getting better at doing so.",0,wi20
"Quiz questions are sometimes, not too often, not clear. Same with some questions on assignments as they can potentially be interpreted differently.",0,wi20

8am lectures,0,wi20
I do not like the weekly quizzes.,0,wi20
"8am lectures, but can't really change anything about that. The fact that to regrade request an assignment, we have to submit a public post to everyone in the class, asking for specific points back, instead of a possible built in regrade button inside the assignments tab under jupyterhub.",0,wi20
"Seems to include a lot of important topics in data science, but only goes very briefly in every single one of them. Might be the purpose so that students are made aware of the basic concepts of such topics in data science and expected to learn deeper concepts in other concentrated classes.",0,wi20
"The coding aspect, because any little mistake can be time costly and misread easily haha.",0,wi20
I do not like how strictly the assignments were graded,0,wi20
Sometimes I feel like I'm getting questions wrong on the quiz not because I misunderstand the topic but rather because the wording in the quizzes was vague or unspecific.,0,wi20

reading quizzes. I don't show up to 8am and have to do reading quizzes. I find that some questions are very lecture specific rather than data science questions. Very hard to get 10 personally.,0,wi20
"Personally, I didn't like some of the guest lectures because I have no interest in startup culture, and mainly want to go into academia. However, they were interesting.",0,wi20

I've been a bit lost on some aspects of the group project related to the ways that we might possibly analyze/model our data. Going to office hours has helped clarify those concerns though,0,wi20
"As a cs major, it took a while to get used to the format of documentations of the tools we use in class such as pandas, or seaborn. I realize there's not much you can do about this, but I just wanted to say it because I found it to be the most frustrating thing in class.",0,wi20
Having it be at 8 am makes it difficult to go,0,wi20
I've least liked how difficult the weekly quizzes are,0,wi20
The homework grading system.,0,wi20
I feel like this class is a repeat of a lot of my other classes so sometimes it is easy to lose interest during lecture.,0,wi20
"Although the assignments are not difficult, there's too few tolerance for faults. A small mistake can cause a significant deduction in the overall grade, and causes a lot of stress on the student. I prefer more difficult assignments with lenient grading that tests the student's knowledge of the course materials rather than whether the student is careful or not. Also, the assignment should focus more on data analysis as a data scientist, and less on some minor details of pandas and python. It would be much less stressful for the student when they know that their grade was deducted because they did not master the material than if it's because they were not careful enough when doing the homework.",0,wi20
"I think while the guest lecturers are interesting, the content that they give us in such a short amount of time is not very useful.",0,wi20

I would like a little bit more structure to discussions. I have attended discussions by different TA's and some tend to have more prepared for discussion than others.

"Personally, a lot of the lectures at the beginning of the course were review, or were just not that engaging in terms of content, so it wasn't that interesting to come to lecture or do any of the introductory assignments. The lectures now are already somewhat more engaging so I think the issue is just that people come into the class with completely different experience levels, and it's just unfortunate that everyone has to go through the introduction to get to the more interesting content.",0,wi20
"I have no real qualms about 108, but the autograder seems a little inflexible (though perhaps I'm just being picky..)",0,wi20

I dislike that the class is at 8am.,0,wi20

learning about what good data analysis consists of,1,sp20
Data Science,1,sp20
I've enjoyed the video lectures the most. I find them very informative and punctual at the same time.,1,sp20
I really enjoy the topics we've learned and I like using Jupyter notebook because it's convenient being able to run code together with the notes. ,1,sp20
Iâ€™ve liked the homework assignments and how they build on what we learned from lectures. Theyâ€™re also not too time consuming which is nice.,1,sp20
"Honestly, it's the fact the there are no tests, the times between when assignments are due are nice and long, which cause no stress and we can do them at our leisure, making sure we really understand the concepts! ",1,sp20
I have enjoyed the format through which the lectures have been provided. The videos that we are responsible for watching are so well-made that I might have ended up watching them even if I was not taking COGS 108 currently.,1,sp20
Working on Assignments ,1,sp20
I like the concept and the Notebook assignments because I have never used pandas before so it is good for me to practice,1,sp20
the assignments have been a great opportunity to get hands-on experience with data science,1,sp20
The assignments are very well-designed and fun to complete.,1,sp20

"Surprisingly, I really like the quizzes because they make it easier for me to assess which concepts I understand and which ones I need to focus on more before the assignments. ",1,sp20
I have enjoyed the video lectures and sections the most. They have been helpful to me.,1,sp20
"I've really enjoyed learning how to use datahub and work with jupyter notebooks. The material feels very relevant to real life, and is genuinely interesting. I also like how the videos are all broken up into segments instead of having one big fifty minute video, because this is way better for my attention span. ",1,sp20
Learning about different packages that I can use inside of Python.,1,sp20
"I've enjoyed how practical the course is so far. I know we haven't gotten to far into the more advanced materials, but I like how were working more with data rather than theory so it feels like I'm actually doing something.",1,sp20
I enjoyed learning about the applications of data science and actually learning about techniques. ,1,sp20
"I have enjoyed seeing how data can be analyzed using Python, and how it comes together when an adequate research question is asked. ",1,sp20
"working with my group.  They are all my friends and I don't get to see them as often (obviously), so it's fun to see and work with them in the group zoom meetings.",1,sp20
I've enjoyed the collaborative work around the final project. ,1,sp20
The lecture material includes both concepts and Jupyter notebook practice.,1,sp20
felt kinda interesting that it combines the knowledge from MATH 183 which I took last quarter and Cogs Science by using Python to analyze data.,1,sp20
The assignments that assess my learning ,1,sp20
The lectures and especially examples used were quite interesting.,1,sp20
Helpful lecture videos,1,sp20
The course offers a relatively comprehensive way to solve problems.,1,sp20

I really enjoy the assignments and what we have learned in the class.,1,sp20
"The lecture videos are great in helping me understand basic data science concepts, and the projects help to put my understanding to practice.",1,sp20
The lecture topics and interactive notebooks we cover as well as how the homework is laid out. I enjoy having the hw broken up step by step as well as the helpful tips along the way!,1,sp20
The assignments are designed so well that we can learn pandas while completing them.,1,sp20

Learning Python. Its been nice to finally have a reason to learn the language ,1,sp20
I have enjoyed learning how to manipulate data and using pandas.,1,sp20
The project proposal was really interesting to write. We spent a lot of time thinking of what we wanted to do and gathering data and prior works was really fun.,1,sp20
"I like the style of the lecture. Each videos are short so it encourages students to learn rather than falling asleep in a 50mins long lecture video. I also like the structure of the hws, they guide students step by step and also encourage students to research more as well",1,sp20
Learning about data science,1,sp20
I learned a lot about panda and analyzing data,1,sp20
How straight forward the lectures and assignments are,1,sp20
I enjoy collaborating with my team about the group project.,1,sp20
I enjoy how straight forward assignments are. ,1,sp20
"Lectures, lectures are really cleared and well-explained. ",1,sp20

"Playing with data, statistics tool",1,sp20
Not too bad,1,sp20
The professor and her humor on piazza. Sheâ€™s very understanding and always willing to help when I am stuck on something.,1,sp20
I have enjoyed lecture the most so far. The professor makes everything very easy to understand with the concept explanations and then the examples in the python notebooks.,1,sp20
Understandable lectures and flexible schedule. I can spend the first half of the week learning material then spend the rest of the week doing the homework.,1,sp20
I like learning about creating more effective and clean sets of data; I think tidy data is important and it helps create meaningful visuals.,1,sp20
organized course content - everything is easy to access and find. Feels like the professor is competent with Canvas/github/remote learning,1,sp20
The lecture notebooks are really helpful,1,sp20
Learning about data frames. I have been using the older method of opening a csv and parsing it line by line.,1,sp20
"I have enjoyed the course material the most. We have been working our way through the scientific method, from question to data to analysis, which I think is pretty cool.",1,sp20
the concept is meaningful,1,sp20
This is the best asynchronous class I am taking this quarter. I enjoy the small lecture + quiz format. It makes it easy to keep on pace with the course.,1,sp20
"The teaching method, this can really help me understand a lot things",1,sp20
Iâ€™ve been enjoying the way lectures are posted on YouTube in a chunk of smaller videos instead of one long 50 minute video.,1,sp20
Programming assignments are interesting,1,sp20
explain the overview of data analysis process,1,sp20
There are a lot of resources available to students. I appreciate Prof. Ellis's flexibility and understanding. She is very helpful during office hours. The course material is interesting and very useful for industry. ,1,sp20
The lectures are very nice,1,sp20
The video lectures and homework assignments have been really enjoyable. I like how the video lectures use examples of application for what is covered in them and the homework has very clear instructions.,1,sp20
Playing with numpy,1,sp20
Working with python has been great! I really wanted to increase my knowledge of python in data analytics and this class is doing a great job at doing so.,1,sp20
Manipulating data and using to understand the relationships between given datasets.,1,sp20
Learning about all the different applications of data science,1,sp20
the short video lectures,1,sp20
I enjoyed the Jupyter notebooks and the exercises that allowed us to see how data science was applied in practice.,1,sp20
The relative controllable pace,1,sp20
"Being able to learn on my own time with the prerecorded lectures and learning about data science is cool. I didn't know too much about data science and how it is used, so this class is pretty interesting. ",1,sp20

The Stats,1,sp20
"Lecture videos are very well done, clear/organized, and interesting, much better than my other classes' videos",1,sp20

The PAs. I've never used Jupiter Note books in other courses. And I like the way how it formats the coding part and text part together. It makes my learning efficient.,1,sp20
Coding!,1,sp20
Learning how to use pandas to wrangle and clean data,1,sp20

Most of all I have enjoyed the topics and the approach this class takes to teaching the topics. The videos are straightforward and get to the point which is nice. ,1,sp20
The wide variety of knowledge and application in python,1,sp20
"I've enjoyed learning more in depth about the data science process through our course material. It's interesting learning about the gist of what data scientists do from a guest lecturer for an hour, but I've found that it's even more interesting to learn about the different pieces of the puzzle/method progressively in an interactive way. I have a larger appreciation for what data scientists do even more so now. ",1,sp20
I really enjoy the lectures video and how its broken down into separate videos; I am able to understand the concepts more easily and can refer back to the videos.,1,sp20
the flexibility of accessing lectures,1,sp20

I liked how I could move at my own pace.,1,sp20
"I have enjoyed many things, learning python, a new environment(datahub/notebooks) learning introductory steps of data science and how to manipulate that data with python. 

But what I have enjoyed most is learning in general this course does a great job of balancing rigor, work, and comprehension time. All the slides are also very appealing to the eye and therefore easier to digest and comprehend. I really enjoy this course.      ",1,sp20
The group project,1,sp20
The assignments have been the most enjoyable and where I actually feel I put to practice what I learn.,1,sp20
I really enjoy all of the data visualization,1,sp20

"the example, like what we can do with the real dataset",1,sp20
"The ease of the course, it helps lower my stress",1,sp20
I've enjoyed the structured videos they are very well done and I like how it is organized. I love that we are actually doing data science as a way to learn about it.,1,sp20
the recorded video,1,sp20
"I really enjoyed how statistics and programming is combined in this course. It starts off very simple and explains both sides. I took a CSE class similar to this course and the professor just assumed you knew how to program and basic statistics terms. There was no datahub so I had to figure out Jupyter Notebooks and python on my own. If I had taken this course before that class, I think I would have enjoyed it more. ",1,sp20
I enjoy interactive learning through Jupyter notebook examples and assignments,1,sp20
The Assignments thus far,1,sp20
How it is broken down simplistically so I can learn efficiently as I am a slow learner and lack a lot of background knowledge that I was scared would hinder me in this class,1,sp20
"I think I've enjoyed the group project the most. I think it was really fun getting to talk to a group of classmates and throw around ideas for a research project. Getting to know what others were interested in and how we might approach answering a question with data analysis was really nice, especially just getting to talk to people again like you would during discussion sections or lecture. ",1,sp20
The way the content is taught is extremely interesting! I like how the videos are split up,1,sp20
I've enjoyed the programming assignments because they help me remember how to use Python,1,sp20
the flexibility that we have with watching lectures,1,sp20

"I have experience learning pandas and I can say that I have enjoyed how you have framed this as well as numpy. I also like how you incorporated git. As a DSC major, no one has really explained the processes under the hood in github and I can say that I was really happy to have learned more about it.",1,sp20
I don't personally care too much about the topics being taught in COGS 108 however what I was really impressed with is how much effort the TAs/Tutors and especially the professor is putting in. I recall on one of the past surveys asking for an open answered response I just put in something semi random but I received an email response back that specifically responded to what I had said. I was really surprised because I think that was the first time I ever received a personalized response to one of the hundreds of surveys I've had to fill out. Seeing you all work hard to respond to all the students showed that you really care about your students makes me want to work hard as well! Also the errors in editing you have sometimes are really funny as well.,1,sp20
I'e enjoyed the interactive notebook for lectures as well as being able to work ahead if i need/ move at my own pace. ,1,sp20

learning visualization and data analysis methods,1,sp20
The idea of working with data (such as A2 assignment),1,sp20
"I love how the class is 1/2 programming and 1/2 subject content. It keeps thing new and engaging. If we only learned code, I know I would be overwhelmed very quickly. If we learned only subject content I know I would feel bored. The mix of both makes me engaged. I also feel if the two weren't mixed in the way they are now, I wouldn't be able to make the same connections with code and content",1,sp20
The data analysis that we covered and what it means in relation to the final project,1,sp20
Understanding data science,1,sp20
I enjoyed attempting to think from the perspective of a data scientist in formulating a project approach.,1,sp20

Writing code. There is immediate feedback and feels like I am learning something useful.,1,sp20
"I've been enjoying the topics covered in the discussion section, which is more focused on the programming aspect of Python. Although as of right now most of the topics are stuff like data structures or concepts that I already have a grasp on, it's really improving my understanding on these things. As a math major, it's a very common occurrence for me to be able to do something programmatically, but not actually understand why it works.

It's also nice that the a lot of the examples on the video lectures are real case studies. It makes it easier to grasp a concept. Some of the stuff like ethics on data science are also things I've never learned before, so it was really interesting for me.",1,sp20
I enjoy the assignments the most because it is practical training.,1,sp20
Learning about how to format data,1,sp20
Group project is very interesting and our group picked a topic we all had a lot of interest in which makes it even better doing the actual project,1,sp20

"Too early to say, but conceptually, the content. I haven't dealt with much that we have learned practically as I have not started on A2, but I am excited based on the topics we have discussed in lecture.",1,sp20
"Learning about the different ways to visualize data has been really interesting. The presentation of data is something that I didn't think too much about before this class, so it was really interesting to learn the different ways data can be visualized. Things like how a data table is organized and how charts differ from one another put data and statistics into context. ",1,sp20
"I think the Professor is really good at presenting complex topics in an easy to understand, and less daunting manner.",1,sp20
"I like the coding part, cuz using code to solve problems is very cool.",1,sp20
I like that the videos are split by topic bc it makes the content more digestable. also the quick quizzes at the end are a good grasp check.,1,sp20
the material told in class,1,sp20
"The fact that quizzes are always Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. It forces a small regularity to my schedule. For example, one of my other classes has weekly quizzes, and I procrastinate until the day that quiz is due to catch up on an entire week's of material. Another one of my classes only has 3 grades: a midterm, another midterm, and a final. Yep, that's it. I only started studying for the first midterm the day of the midterm.",1,sp20
data,1,sp20

online classes. I don't have to wake up at 8 am in the morning!,1,sp20
Able to concretely learn things about data science that I had only loosely learned before.,1,sp20
I enjoyed learning about the different concepts associated with data science and how they are relevant in different real world examples. Learning about git was also very useful information.,1,sp20
The professor's assumption that with some terms/ideas we might not be familiar with yet. This has elevated some pressure off the students for sure! I also think that splitting the lectures into parts to focus on specific topics has been important for me to sort and locate that information when necessary.,1,sp20

I don't really enjoy the quizzes but it makes sense since it forces us to watch the lecture,0,sp20
"I don't like the clarity of grading. I feel like the quizzes often have some questions that ask about something that's really nuanced & I understand that the questions can't all be easy, but I don't think those question topics get enough attention in the video to give us the opportunity to have deeper thought about them. I also wish there was a way to turn in the assignments and see the grade on them before they're due (without necessarily seeing the correct answer) so we can get a better idea of how they're going.",0,sp20

I only took cogs 18, so I am only really familiar with Jupyter notebooks; Github is very confusing and I don't really know how to do code on my local computer outside of jupyter.

"Sometimes I forget to do the quizzes, which is on me, but some days the quizzes will be worth only 6 points in total and other days it will be worth like 15 points in total, and we only have 20 free points. So if you forgot on a day where thereâ€™s not a lot of points, itâ€™s fine, but if you forget on a day with a lot of points you could be using almost all your 20 free points on one day. I know itâ€™s ideal that you donâ€™t forget but it would make more sense if the quizzes were worth the same points every day. I wish there was the ability to take the quizzes up to a day late for a little bit of credit. Itâ€™s hard adjusting to online learning and Iâ€™m not used to remembering to have to take a quiz every other day. Itâ€™s different being in my home environment as opposed to being at school where I wouldnâ€™t forget to go to lecture. I just feel like theyâ€™re not really equivalent and I wish there was some more leniency.",0,sp20

"Definitely the quizzes. I don't have a big problem with having quizzes themselves but at times it feels like its just a bunch of busy work with no leniency on deadlines. I understand that you open up the quizzes the weekend before but a lot of the time I have another class that has priority for an assignment that's due Sun night, Mon night, etc. I believing something like having an extra day for the quizzes would help out a lot at times (Mon quizzes due Tue night, Wed due Thurs night, etc) as it would let me work on whatever I have to finish at the time and not have the COGS quiz in the back of my mind haunting me. One other thing for me personally is just having a little bit more time on some of the quizzes. I've always been a bit of a slow test taker and regarding these quizzes where sometimes the answer is one small thing mentioned in a 20 minute video I find myself going back and forward making sure I have the right answer and it eats up a lot of time for other questions. Adding something like 15 - 30 seconds on each question for the quizzes would help out a lot for me personally.",0,sp20

Quizzes taken after the lecture videos. It feels difficult a lot of the time to take a quiz based on material that I just finished learning for the first time and am still processing while also affecting my grade.,0,sp20
"I don't like how I can't see other people besides my project team. I feel like I probably would have made friends in this class if there were actual in-person lectures to go to. I think this is most frustrating since I'm not very familiar with using git/Github. I know that there are tutorials online, but it's almost always easier to have someone to help in real-time. I'm very nervous about using it, still.",0,sp20
The material. I am extremely bad at python and data science and I have honestly no idea what I'm doing in this class. I have such little coding experience (of which none is in python) so for me I'm really struggling in this class. I'm not sure what would help me or make this class easier. At this point it might be easier to change my grading option to P/NP. Please send help.,0,sp20
The course is set up well and I have no real complaints. Attendance is not required and quizzes/assignments are fair.,0,sp20
quiz with time limit,0,sp20
The fact that it is offered online (through no fault of the professor). I learn better in an actual classroom because there is less distractions.,0,sp20

How tricky the quizzes are since there's no way to know what to pay attention to ,0,sp20
I think the quiz timer is a bit too short. I didn't have time to think about my answer,0,sp20
It feels like we glance over a lot of the material without applying it in another context than the example in the lecture. I think this concern has been augmented by the fact that we're not about to enter into discussions during a collective lecture. I suppose when I finish the second assignment I will have a more clear idea about how we are being tested for understanding of the materials.,0,sp20
PA's assessment isnt clear ,0,sp20

The short video is kinda dun because the professor broke it into several part and the way she explains it is very clear,0,sp20
"honestly this class is pretty good, i like everything about it. i guess the only thing i don't like is the fact that its online. I feel like having the experience in class, and getting the chance to interact with other students and the instructor in person would make this class even better than it already is.",0,sp20
Writing reports. It is tedious and mind-numbingly boring.,0,sp20
"-) A few of the github links seem to be broken or missing , like the ones for the individual project proposals. The template in the ipynb file was for the group project instead, and I had to go to a specific file path in order to find the correct template. 

-) I'm the type of person that likes to do assignments on one sitting and be done with it, so the video quizzes has been a bit of a hassle for me. I get that I can just finish the video assignments at the beginning of the week but it's a different kind of studying than doing the programming assignments, which is what I'm used to, if that makes sense. With the videos I really have to focus on them for ~10 minutes at a time, do the quiz, and then focus on another thing on the next video. It's also harder for me because I have ADD.

I totally understand that this is due to the sudden change of the course structure though, and I appreciate that these accommodations are made. This is just me being nitpicky lol.",0,sp20
"Even though I like the assignments, I dislike using Python and Pandas. I do not like dynamically typed languages. The Pandas documentation is overly verbose, and I find the design nonsensical and overly complicated. ",0,sp20

"The lack of leniency on the video quiz. I understand that the professor is generous enough to give 20 free quiz points, and students really do appreciate it. But I also hope that the professor and TAs know that us students can make a lot of mistakes, especially when it comes to managing our time. Some of us can get carried away with projects and work in other classes that we forget to take the video quizzes. Instead of restricting the quiz right away after the deadline, maybe implement a late penalty for them. This is just a suggestion, I am not in any ways trying to tell the professor and TAs how to do their job. However, I do hope you guys can take this input into account.",0,sp20
"Perhaps some of the quiz questions aren't as clear as I'd like. Some questions seem ambiguous in the way they're asked, and I can't tell if they want it answered very technically or just generally how we learned it.",0,sp20

"I think the part I like least so far is group projects because they are very communication orientated and at points I feel like not contributing. It's because I haven't been normalized into group project settings yet. But in another light, I see this as an opportunity to be less afraid of working with other people and to learn to voice ideas to others!",0,sp20
"Sometimes I do struggle with components of the assignments (for example, wondering what Q3D is asking for, etc.), but I can't tell if it's because it's genuinely challenging or if my programming skills require additional brushing-up. I'm sure it's the latter though, because once I attend office hours, it clears up a lot of the confusion! (More about the TA below)",0,sp20

some topics are difficult,0,sp20
"The bulk of my worries with COGS108 comes from the assignments as they have been slightly tedious for me, mainly because I find myself getting confused at times due to the wording and that caused me to lose major points in A1. Also, I feel as though I was not entirely prepared for this course, since I did not have too much familiarity with Python, github, and datahub. Therefore, when doing the assignments I constantly find myself having to do more research that adds to the workload before I can understand if I am on the right track.",0,sp20
"This isn't really the fault of the class, but just online learning in general is difficult.",0,sp20
"The lecture quizzes, to be honest. I understand that the quizzes are meant to keep us on track when it comes to lecture material. However, I feel like (in my opinion), that there should be more flexibility when it comes to the quizzes. For example, in my opinion, there should be a little bit more time allotted for each question on the quiz, not 1 minute per question. I feel like allotting only one minute per question creates more pressure and its not enough time to come up with the correct answer or too look back at the notes to make sure/confirm the answer (especially when you accidentally missed something in the lectures). Also, allowing multiple attempts on the lecture quizzes could be nice too (without exposing the correct answers after taking it, of course), as this can make us look back at the lectures or lecture notes to see what we've missed and possibly got wrong. At the end of the day, it is your call as the professor. These are just suggestions to possibly consider to create a slightly better learning environment. Other than that though, no complaints :)",0,sp20
"I think the course is too spread out which causes the problem of too little attention for important topics. For example, while I was looking through the Linear Regression videos, I found that the videos did not nearly cover the detail required and that a lot of the important points were skimmed over too quickly. I have extensive experience in Statistics and in particular Linear Regression, but if I were a beginner who hadn't taken a college level Statistics course, I would really struggle to get all that detail in such a short space of time. To be clear, this isn't a criticism of teaching (Professor Ellis is one of the very best professors I've had the pleasure of learning from at UCSD), but one of time. I understand that quite a lot of topics need to be covered in this course, but perhaps the course can afford to lose some of the materials that are going to be covered to create time for future batches. 

Suggestion to fix this issue: After this quarter, the Professor will have a collection of videos which explain the topics really well. A possible solution is that some of the less engaging topics can be taught (say the earlier videos about Git and GitHub, some basic programming concepts such as pandas which students can easily pick up through online video and Jupyter Notebook Walkthroughs as well as by looking at the documentation available online) to the students via this medium while lecture time can be used for more engaging material (like going through the assumptions of Linear Regression and t-tests with more thoroughness and perhaps explaining the intuition behind those things, a full example of real-life data science projects etc).",0,sp20

Using datahub to see applications of the material we are learning,1,fa20
The assignments,1,fa20
I enjoy the pace of the class thus far. I enjoy how the class does not assume much prior knowledge despite the fact that it is possible many individuals joined the class with said prior knowledge.,1,fa20
"I really enjoy the introduction to Python, data science, and jupyter notebooks. As a computer science major, I have yet to take any data science courses, but I am aware computer science is heavily involved in data science and I am glad this class has introduced me to field to see if I enjoy it. As someone who has also never coded in Python before, I think its useful that I am being introduced to the language. Lastly, knowing of Jupyter Notebooks for so long, I am glad to finally be learning the tool.",1,fa20
structure and organization of the course,1,fa20

I like that the lectures are posted before the weekend so that I can watch them over the weekend when I have more free time. ,1,fa20
"I know next to nothing about coding (save for writing loops and what I have so far learned in this class), and yet this class has already put the idea in my head of maybe wanting to be a data scientist. I enjoy the fact that the professor seems to have communicated the practice of data science effectively, and from the persuasive perspective of someone who enjoys doing it. Genuinely, thank you Professor Ellis for turning my most feared class of the quarter into my favorite one. ",1,fa20
the ease of doing lectures and quizzes,1,fa20
"Working with my group mates, this is my first time doing a data science project and it has been fun working with them and learning more",1,fa20

"Python, interesting lectures and guest speaker, ",1,fa20
I have learned how to deal with data and that is amazing.,1,fa20
I really like the coding portion from the assignments,1,fa20
"I am enjoying the Python applications of what we're leaning about statistics. I've spent time learning about it in theory, but using it in practice is always cool to implement and see. I've done so before with Math 185 in R, but Python feels more approachable for most people so it's interesting to try it there.",1,fa20
"I've enjoyed learning about data viz and how to use it, especially with the different libraries.",1,fa20
Learning to use python libraries to be able to actually do practical data science projects. Using the libraries like pandas and seaborn have helped me in my familiarity with these packages and confidence in performing more data science projects in the future. ,1,fa20

"I have enjoyed doing actual hands on work in Jupyter with pandas and dataframe, especially coming from a background of little coding knowledge. ",1,fa20
"I think I've enjoyed getting a more hands on experience with the coding aspect of the class, even though it is kind of difficult. It gives me experience with Python that I think is valuable both in class and outside the class too. I do especially enjoy the take home quizzes that makes the class easier to engage with the material. ",1,fa20
i enjoy the teaching style and pace. short video draw my attention that i do not easily lose my interest on those topics and the quiz are helpful for learning knowledge,1,fa20
Assignment,1,fa20
Clear lecture vide,1,fa20
"I've enjoyed working with my group to navigate the details of our project. We are all new to data science, so the process of learning and researching has been fun. ",1,fa20
I really like learning about pandas dataframe and how to work efficiently with data,1,fa20
yes! The course content is useful and group project is fun!,1,fa20
The assignments are very useful for learning new skills.,1,fa20
the python programming,1,fa20
The structure of the lectures. Watching videos that are around 20 minutes is more bearable to watch than those that are over an hour long.,1,fa20
the class is organized very well,1,fa20
"The lectures, I like how they are broken down into small chunks for me to digest and understand",1,fa20
Learning about data wrangling and practicing it,1,fa20
"Excellent Lectures, clean and easy access to everything",1,fa20

I enjoyed to learn the new Python libraries like pandas. I think it will help me in the future in my Data Science projects.,1,fa20
I really like the asynchronous aspect of the course.,1,fa20
"Yes. I found COGS 108 is very helpful for my future career, and I can handle most of the materials of it.",1,fa20
The coding assignments. I appreciate how detailed the instructions and its clearly states what it wants us to do.,1,fa20
Experiencing the life of  a data scientist. It is a career that I am interested in.,1,fa20
The most interesting part of learning in COGS 108 is how much of can be applied to the real world problems.,1,fa20
"The assignments, they are the hands on portion of what we learn in lecture",1,fa20
Learning Python is pretty interesting since I never thought of creating high-quality graphs from coding. ,1,fa20
"I like that the prerecorded videos are clear, concise, and edited down to the important points. ",1,fa20
Self-paced lectures,1,fa20
I enjoy deciding different kinds of graphs to use with different kinds of data. ,1,fa20
I love your lectures and how they are broken down. They are super informative and I don't fine myself loosing focus when I am watching them!,1,fa20
The bottom-up approach that assignments take in testing the material. I like how each assignment builds up to a large result (ie A3 with the final graph with linreg plotted).,1,fa20
The quizzes after each lecture allow me to truly see whether or not I understand the material that was taught in each video,1,fa20
The homework assigments,1,fa20
I enjoyed learning about data science techniques,1,fa20
Jupyter notebook is so exciting!,1,fa20
Learning how to use jupyter,1,fa20
the freedom to podcast whenever,1,fa20
I enjoy how informative the videos are,1,fa20
"What is a Data Analysis, how the data should be gathered before starting everything, how data should be prepared change my previous understanding of data science.",1,fa20
What I have enjoyed most about COGS 108 is how learning in this class is not impeded by natural instinct or talent in statistics or programming. Having the actual curiosity itself lends itself as a gateway to solving the problems when you are allowed to google things to experiment with and you have output to verify if your findings align with what is asked.,1,fa20
I enjoy the use of code in order to interpret and clean up data. I never knew that there were so many useful functions from programs like pandas and numpy that could streamline so many things.,1,fa20
Guest lecture! Vivian Peng is awesome!!!,1,fa20
The data visualization and tools have proven to be very useful. I am currently interning at Qualcomm and I immediately apply the knowledge I use in my work. ,1,fa20
Relatively clear expectations and well formatted lectures,1,fa20
"I enjoyed all the lessons on python coding, I know the point of this class is data analysis and not coding, but I really like coding. I also really like the way quizzes and videos are cut into chunks.",1,fa20
learning pandas. I think pandas would be useful in the future,1,fa20
Course video. Really help understand materials while maximize flexibility,1,fa20
the examples in class,1,fa20
"The homework, which gives very specific instructions and familiarizes me with the pandas package.",1,fa20
"I enjoy the lectures because although I'm not a Data Science major, it's always been something I've interested in, so it's cool to get exposed to this stuff!",1,fa20
Learning about and working with tools for data science. I've never done data science before so I enjoy working with pandas and analyzing data,1,fa20
The fact that it's in Python and we get to work on a project on our own. I love my team's project idea and I think it has motivated me to spend a lot of my off time writing code for it. ,1,fa20
I enjoyed the assignments and the office hours the most. I love how tutors explain the material so well to me and I hope it was more office hours or some 1-1 sessions.,1,fa20
I have enjoyed the lectures about data visualization and things to be careful about. I had no idea how important this aspect of data science is.,1,fa20
The content I have learned in this course is really practical and useful.,1,fa20
"coding assignments, they're really fun to do because I feel like I'm applying the knowledge that I learned from class ",1,fa20
the good lectures and style of teaching,1,fa20
I have enjoyed some of the lectures. I think they are interesting and informative. ,1,fa20
The most interesting part of learning in COGS 108 is how much of can be applied to the real world problems.,1,fa20
I actually like the Jupyter Notebook Python assignments as a way to learn about python and panda as I have no previous experience with the language,1,fa20
"I love the new topics we cover every week, and they're applicability in our data science project",1,fa20
The assignments are structured in a way that I actually learn the information asked,1,fa20
"Learning how to work with data using Python; lectures, including the guest speaker",1,fa20
the short videos every week ,1,fa20
"How the class is formatted, with no exams and lectures are videos that we can watch on our own time. I like these aspects because I feel less pressured to know everything in the course but am still actively learning.",1,fa20
I really enjoy the assignments. I find them challenging and fun to work on. ,1,fa20
The homework data were interesting. I didn't know tootsie roll was both fruity and chocolaty.,1,fa20
The fun and practical approach towards learning.,1,fa20
"The mini quizzes and the length of the short videos, but its rich, easily absorbable content. ",1,fa20
The videos and homework are clear,1,fa20
Python,1,fa20
"What I have enjoyed the most about COGS 108 so far are the lecture videos. They take less time than expected to complete, and are split up in a way so that I can take a break in between sets of videos.",1,fa20
Expanding my perspective on all the different things you can do with data and just how powerful and life-changing data can be. ,1,fa20
"the python, learning about what makes a data set good, what makes it bad.",1,fa20
it's more practical,1,fa20
"The assignments are very intuitive and basic and provide me with basic understanding of pandas and all the functionality that will be beneficial for a successful project. Therefore, I have enjoyed the assignments a lot.",1,fa20
"I honestly really liked the podcast-interview styled guest lecture with Vivian Peng. It was good to see the trajectory of someone's career (academic or otherwise) and how that related to data science, as well as having a few examples of how creativity and data science meet.",1,fa20
I like how there is a proper structure to the course.,1,fa20
Python basics.,1,fa20
I enjoy most on the material that is on the videos because they are very encouraging and interesting. The videos are where I learn the most. ,1,fa20
I have enjoyed learning how to use python and pandas. I did not feel confident with my coding skills but the assignments have helped me understand more the importance of syntax. ,1,fa20
The easy going pace of learning python,1,fa20
Piazza posts and videos. They are the most helpful with answering questions and are very useful,1,fa20
The guest lecturer. She really encouraged me and gave me so much hope for the future.,1,fa20
"I've been curious about data science but didn't know where to start, so I like the structured design and introduction of fundamentals that lead into more complex ideas",1,fa20
Python coding,1,fa20
Guest speakers since it is nice to hear their experiences and advice.,1,fa20
"I like how easy the lectures are to follow, I wish classes could be in person ,but I still find the lectures enjoyable and how each video is separated according to topic rather than having an hour long video with everything combined",1,fa20
Learning about data science and working with the pandas package. Working on the group project has also been fun so far.,1,fa20
The hands on nature of the assignments without being too difficult. ,1,fa20
I have enjoyed how flexible the course is and how I know due dates in advance ,1,fa20
It is cool that we can work on a read dataset,1,fa20
Being able to learn more about data analysis skills ,1,fa20
I enjoyed working with my group and being able to explore ideas with them.,1,fa20
"I have really enjoyed applying Python to the applications in this class. Coming from a cs background, I find it very valuable being able to apply my knowledge of programming in a different field like Data Science.",1,fa20
the guest lecture,1,fa20
"The videos are really well put together, informative, and concise.",1,fa20
The assignments. They are a challenge as I am new to programing and my last coding course was years ago but working through them has been rewarding,1,fa20
The mini lectures,1,fa20
Pacing of lecture (how information is broken up into manageable videos) and pandas library,1,fa20
PAs,1,fa20
The lecture recordings + the guest lecturer,1,fa20
The quick videos that I actually remember,1,fa20
"Using what we learn in lectures in our programming assignments, something I missed in COGS9",1,fa20
Group Project,1,fa20
The lectures are interesting,1,fa20
I've really liked being able to code again as the Cogs department is rather sparse in coding courses.,1,fa20
The assignments,1,fa20
The videos are the perfect length for understanding concepts,0,fa20
Assignment is kind of difficult to me. I never learned how to google some concepts,0,fa20
"Honestly, I am not a huge fan of remote learning, I would say thats the biggest problem right now. I feel like it takes away from the actual COGS 108 experience.",0,fa20
I'm not familiar with python and panda.,0,fa20
hmmm I feel like I am a little bit lost on how to conduct the final project along the course cause we are constantly learning new techniques,0,fa20
Nothing really so far. It's been nice.,0,fa20
On the homeworkâ€™s I have to consistently struggle on questions and look up functions and syntax on google because I did not learn them from lecture,0,fa20
super random but I don't like how the lecture videos don't open a new tab when I click on them from github. but obviously this is a very minor thing,0,fa20
"I don't really have any major beef with this class so far, so I can't really complain.",0,fa20
I honestly think all parts of COGS 108 has been great so far!,0,fa20
On the homeworkâ€™s I have to consistently struggle on questions and look up functions and syntax on google because I did not learn them from lecture,0,fa20
Some of the assignment multiple choice questions. They can be tricky at times.  ,0,fa20
i feel like there are too many quizzes and that it is stressful to keep up with constantly ,0,fa20
"This was the very first time I ever had to use github (not a Cogs major so definitely new to this) and I felt that there were very little guidance I was given to validate that component of the assignment (it wasn't a lot of work, but it was worth a lot and I had no way of knowing if I did it correctly). I lost a point for a silly reason - but I spent around 15-30 min on that portion as opposed to the 3 hours on the actual assignment of the material that was taught on class. To lose 13% of the entire assignment (or 1% of my entire grade) for that mistake was pretty hurtful.",0,fa20
Nothing to be honest.,0,fa20
Quiz on guest talk,0,fa20
Writing out my project proposal because writing is my weak point,0,fa20
No complaints.,0,fa20
The Final Project - a lot of freedom and flexibility ,0,fa20
I think during lecture we don't really go in depth into different concepts and they can only really be reinforced or learned by doing the assignments.,0,fa20
"I don't really like doing lecture quizzes, but I do them early so they're not too bad.",0,fa20
So far so good!,0,fa20
A3 was not released on Monday as it was promised; it was released on Tuesday instead. And no one responded during these times that A1 was being graded; might be nice to have one dedicated answerer during these times tbh,0,fa20
What I've liked least is that some of the main course documents are only on GitHub while I think some of the important ones should be on Canvas as well just for easier access. ,0,fa20
The individual proposal felt sort of confusing to do since our data set is predetermined.,0,fa20
The quiz answers can be tricky sometimes. ,0,fa20
"Sometimes it's difficult to get help because there are so many students in office hours, but I understand that it's such a big class and all the TAs are very helpful. ",0,fa20
"I have enjoyed the project proposal the least because it had asked us to prepare a possible question before we learned the different models and data science experiments (e.g. exploratory, inferential, etc.)",0,fa20
Slow feedback time on assignment grades (especially if an autograder grades it),0,fa20
"Group work - It takes up too much energy to work with 4 other UCSD students over the zoom call. Also,  I feel like everyone's expectation in this class is different.",0,fa20
"It can be difficult to pay attention to some of the longer lecture videos (that go through the notebooks, for example) without taking a lot of breaks.",0,fa20
Spending time debugging my coding errors,0,fa20
"1. The longer video lectures mostly because they are on the Python notebook and it's a little harder to take notes about code going on. I usually just download the notebook as a pdf and take notes on it directly as appropriate.
2. I really don't like that I can't see the answers on the quizzes right away. I never go back to check them because I always forget (also because I do them the weekend it is released and answers come out a week later so I don't even remember the ones I got wrong by then). I wished it were unlimited trys because I think it would've given me more incentive to know the right answers as I am taking the quiz.",0,fa20
the final project with less directions,0,fa20
I wish there were some synchronous lectures.,0,fa20
The video quizzes. Some questions are really confusing and not representative.,0,fa20
The quiz is sometime hard.,0,fa20
"quiz
I always got one question wrong",0,fa20
"project, as communication through zoom is not effective",0,fa20
I think having live lectures (that are recorded to later go back to) rather than recorded videos would be beneficial to maintain that classroom interaction between students and the professor.,0,fa20
"Question design of quiz/assignment. Some quiz questions have multiple viable answers, but some aren't considered correct because they aren't explicitly mentioned in the lecture. A1's git task might need extra guidance for students once waitlisted, and it might not want to deduct points solely based on naming errors.",0,fa20
The content quizzes,0,fa20
I think the lectures are kind of long and they take me twice as long to do because I pause to take notes for them. ,0,fa20
I wish there was a more set/required time frame for final project progress to keep us on track.,0,fa20
The project proposal was confusing to me to do as an individual project. I wish the individual project could be done over the term as well. I am worried about doing the individual project during the last week of classes.,0,fa20
"Tis a great class, I don't think there is anything I particularly dislike.",0,fa20
It makes me want to cry because of how I don't understand sometimes. ,0,fa20
"I would prefer the due date for the Friday quizzes be on Saturday at least, because unlike the Monday and Wednesday quizzes, it feels much stricter.",0,fa20
Quizzes ,0,fa20
The daily quizzes are the worst.,0,fa20
"I like the quizzes the least. I often feel that I have gotten a good understanding of the lecture videos but still didn't do well in quizzes. Also, it happened to me once that I mistakenly started a quiz next to the one I wanted to click, and ended up getting almost 0 points since I haven't watched the corresponding video yet. I think it would be better if we could get 2 chances for a single quiz, and this could also help us to recapture the contents that we were not familiar enough too.",0,fa20
I wish the assignments were released earlier so that I could better allocate my time,0,fa20
I think the grading is a bit too harsh.,0,fa20
The A# have been rather tedious so far,0,fa20
The assignments are a bit long.,0,fa20
"I dislike the style of the lecture quizzes, mainly how there's only one attempt. It's adding additional stress to the course that I don't think is necessary, because it would be nice to be able to watch the videos without having to worry so much about performing well on the quizzes. ",0,fa20
nothing really to hate,0,fa20
"Pressure on the quizzes; sometimes the time limit feels too short, especially for questions such as the ones asking what graph would be the best choice for a given situation",0,fa20
"The quizzes are a (very) tiny bit anxiety inducing. Although I put my focus on the videos, the quizzes make me question myself quite a bit, especially when there are select all questions where some answers cause me confusion. ",0,fa20
"More coding tutoring (supplemental materials) is needed because I don't have a strong background in python, so it took a longer time for me to try out and process things. ",0,fa20
I guess the assignments since a lot of it we have to figure out on our own so a question can take a long while to solve. ,0,fa20
Nothing.,0,fa20
I like everything about this class,0,fa20
taking content quizes ,0,fa20
The week1 quizzes are tricky.,0,fa20
"The main project. I posed a question that I found interesting and did background research, but since turning it in, you have discussed predictive analysis and text analysis. I want to try these out in my project, but I don't know if I can change. I kinda wish there was a slack or piazza channel for the people doing the individual projects to discuss. ",0,fa20
The daily quizzes are probably what I like least about the class because some of the questions have been a bit ambiguous. ,0,fa20
Nothing worth noting,0,fa20
Answering quizes,0,fa20
I wish have more explain on the code part of the lecture.,0,fa20
Group Project work,0,fa20
"Don't have a lot practice, I think I will forget things fast.",0,fa20
"Some questions in quizzes are not so straightforward, and having only one attempt and limited time can be stressful.",0,fa20
Feeling unconfident in my final project group,0,fa20
Vague participation quiz questions,0,fa20
There is a lot of Python I need to learn.,0,fa20
"sometimes the videos each week take me a while because I like to take notes, and the quiz questions are sometimes unfair since there could be multiple answers.",0,fa20
The individual project proposal was challenging for me since I knew nothing about the data set so it might have been nice to know that my question was at least a little bit more on track,0,fa20
"The quizzes for each lecture. The quizzes are very difficult and I have lost a lot of points because of how specific they are. I think that if they are truly trying to gauge our understanding of the lecture we should have two or three attempts on each quiz. After submission we should be able to see which we got correct and which were wrong, not the correct answers. Then we should have the opportunity to retake it. I understand that we can miss points on the quizzes and still earn an A in the course but it should not be this difficult to earn these points if you just want to make sure we watch the lectures and understand the material.",0,fa20
"These EC surveys! This is the first one I've done, for some reason I didn't know about them until now. Prob missed a lot of free points!",0,fa20
Not much; Professor Ellis has been doing a great job so far. ,0,fa20
The final project because I dont know how it will turn out,0,fa20
"What I like least is probably the quizzes. I feel like there's a lot of quizzes, and while most of them are  not hard, there a few that I felt weren't really supposed to be taken right after watching the lecture but instead meant to be taken after I have had practice with the concept",0,fa20
some lecture quiz questions are too difficult,0,fa20
more structure for the group project/more support from TA/IA's,0,fa20
"I guess I find the Jupyter notebook videos very dense and technical, but they're supposed to be that way and are helpful in completing assignments as a result. ",0,fa20
"The thing I like least about COGS 108 so far is that it stacks on top of my COGS 109 assignments and the only other coding-based class i've taken is COGS 18 so I can feel a bit overwhelmed with learning how to do things sometimes. But with the class itself, I actually enjoy it a lot!",0,fa20
"I feel like there is a slight disconnect from our final project and the class itself. I understand that we are learning the tools we need for our project in lecture, but I don't feel like we can immediately apply these specific learning points in such an open-ended project. Maybe it would be helpful to have weekly project goals connected to the weekly lecture content.",0,fa20
Lack of guidance in some of the homework where syntax is very specific,0,fa20
"My least favorite part of the course are the video quizzes only because we only have one attempt. I appreciate the fact that we get 10 free points toward the quizzes, but maybe with multiple attempts we could have a better chance at getting 100% on the quizzes and not need the 10 free points.",0,fa20
I enjoy this class,0,fa20
Probably the lecture quizzes just because I get thrown on every multiple-answer question and miss it.,0,fa20
"The quizzes. The quizzes stress me out since we have them every other day and there aren't many points to them, so if I missed one point, I basically failed the quiz. ",0,fa20
"The quizzes. I wish they weren't timed because I think I would do better on them given more time. While I am actively listening and taking notes over the videos, I do miss some details that are brought up in the quiz and I wish I had more time to go back and revisit that topic (especially if it is important enough to be covered on the quiz). ",0,fa20
"I don't really like how quizzes have to be done the day of by midnight, because sometimes i have a hectic day with other classes, work, and other things",0,fa20
It is ok. Thank you!,0,fa20
Very rare but sometimes I feel like the quiz questions were more vague or had multiple interpretations for certain ones ,0,fa20
"I wish for the quizzes we had an additional try or at least deadline extended to Saturday because every quiz (besides Friday) has a few days to be completed, so it would make sense for the Friday quiz to at least have one day of leniency.",0,fa20
the quizzes feel more of a requirement than an actual learning check ,0,fa20
I don't enjoy working on individual project so far because everything is virtual and it is harder for me to ask for help. It also seems very intimidating to finish up a Data science project on my own without much coding knowledge and without in person help. ,0,fa20
"Possibly because of the COVID-19 environment, but I do miss the feeling of being in a legitimate lecture environment and having synchronous lectures, as it gives me more of reason to actually attend lecture.",0,fa20
Quiz questions are too ambiguous,0,fa20
The PAs are a little bit challenging. I feel that lecture videos do not do a sufficient job in  preparing me for the PA,0,fa20
I wish there was a synchronous lecture at least once a week because it feels like I'm just self learning.,0,fa20
"I feel as though I'm not encouraged to take notes at all. I find it hard to take notes in coding classes, but even here still with more concepts, I find that I don't reach for my notebook often to write down important concepts. This could be a me problem, though, because the slides do have bullet points that outline the lesson and what you're going to say.",0,fa20
"I know professor give us easiest quzzies, but I feel that the time is too short.",0,fa20
some quiz questions can be tricky,0,fa20
There is not too much help regarding programming like CSE with the tutor labs.,0,fa20
I think that Python should be the only prerequisite for the course as opposed to Java. It would have been easier to start out with more comfortability in Python before starting the class.,0,fa20
None of I can think of so far.,0,fa20
Quizzes because a lot of the questions can be a bit confusing with the wording. ,0,fa20
I think some of the questions have been frustratingly ambiguous every once in a while. 95% of the time they are good representations of the content in the videos but every once in a while the answer is definitely not clear even if you watched the video.,0,fa20
Too easy. As a DSC major who has taken DSC10-80 much of the course is repeated material for me,0,fa20
The final project weights too much and becomes too decisive to our grades.,0,fa20
"The stress, since it is something that does not come easily to me, having to code is hard for me to understand sometimes, formatting specifically is what trips me up.",0,fa20
"I have least liked the pace of the class. For the first few weeks, everything seemed to be going off at a good pace, however, I feel now that we are moving a bit fast. ",0,fa20
"Working on the group project, it has been difficult logistically for us to work on the project",0,fa20
"There are too many quizzes, although manageable. Some questions in the first two weeks' quizzes are too detailed. ",0,fa20
Tricky canvas quiz questions,0,fa20
I miss raising my hand and asking questions in real time. ,0,fa20
The video quizzes being due the same day the video is released. It's been ok so far but the asynchronicity of my classes has made scheduling myself to do these quizzes sometimes difficult.,0,fa20
I like everything,0,fa20
A1,0,fa20
"I'm just mad I saved this class for last because it's the last class I need before graduating. Overall really great course, lectures are easy to follow, and assignments are fun.",0,fa20
"A few of the quizzes had questions that weren't related to the material discussed in the lecture (the data viz lectures, iirc)",0,fa20
I feel like I'm learning very slowly and I'm worried my level of coding is making it hard for me to contribute a lot for my group.,0,fa20
Doesn't feel like the hw and lectures are solidly connected,0,fa20
What I have like the least about COGS 108 has been having to write the project proposal. I disliked that because I feel like I didn't have enough knowledge of the tools I'm able to use for the project in order to form a plan on what topic I was choosing.,0,fa20
Honestly. I wish that the reading quizzes had unlimited time. I don't see a reason to add such a short time period other than to make it more difficult. ,0,fa20
"I am struggling the most with the fact of how hard it can be to handle work for both the project, the lectures, the quizzes, and the assignments. The project takes many more hours than expected, and so far the only thing that keeps me going and makes me prioritize this class over others is my interest in the project. It could help a lot to have a bit more guidance on our projects, so that we can stay on track with time and find resources on time. ",0,fa20
"Nothing, I am really enjoying the class so far!",0,fa20
"Things in the assignments are not always explained in the lectures so I get confused as to how to do some things in the assignment, especially more complicated things.",0,fa20
"The sudden change in assignment due date frequency. I know that the schedule made it clear when assignments were due, but I was used to the two week gap between each assignment and now there is a one week gap.",0,fa20
"I find it generally quite hard to focus on the videos. Lastly, I think there is a lot of pressure to perform well on the quizzes and they often have questions that are a little tricky.",0,fa20
Project proposal instructions were ambiguous,0,fa20
Prof introduces little codes,0,fa20
the video quiz part. I think sometimes questions were very tricky and cannot represent the material we learn,0,fa20
I think the assignment has too low total score and it causes 1 point deduction on the total grade if we got 1 point deducted on one homework.,0,fa20
I think the assignment takes a very large part on total grade and have too low total points for each assignment. Therefore 1 point deducted on one assignment will cause one point deducted on the total average grade.,0,fa20
I like everything,0,fa20
I don't really like the weekly quizzes although I do understand that they are necessary.,0,fa20
"Learning git, github, and anaconda. Not especially a bad thing--it was just on the more difficult end for me",0,fa20
trying to actually find data sets for the project,0,fa20
"I dislike the ambiguity of some questions because it felt like some of the 'select all that apply' could have more or fewer answers depending on how the question was considered. However, I feel like last week's was definitely less ambiguous. ",0,fa20
Nothing that quickly comes to mind.,0,fa20
The online format could be better. More interaction with students is what I mean. It is hard to do it through canvas so not really a complaint but just my opinion.,0,fa20
"Not about COGS 108, but I probably should have waited a bit to refine my coding skills a bit more before I take this class.",0,fa20
The proposal took a long time to be returned. I want it to be returned soon so I can send out surveys which will take a long time,0,fa20
I can't think of anything that I do not like in the class.,0,fa20
"Maybe deadlines for things can be extended til saturday and not just friday. For this week, we have the daily quiz and the A3 due on the same night.",0,fa20
"I dislike how quizzes are graded. For most of my other classes with quizzes, they are graded for effort, which usually means if you scored a certain percentage of the quiz correctly (e.g. 75%) you get full points. Having a leeway of 10 points to cover for a missed week coupled on with points lost due to minor errors in quizzes can add up by the end of the quarter and make somewhat of an impact on the final grade.",0,fa20
I've disliked the project proposal because the topic was not very interesting to me.,0,fa20
"Learning how to use Git commands was definitely difficult despite carefully watching the lecture videos about that topic. The commands seem straightforward in lecture, but in practice doing a simple commit push was very ambiguous in practice since the UI is very complicated and everyoneâ€™s personal machines are different.

The guest lecture ,0,fa20
I wouldn't say I don't like it but I feel unprepared as of now for the group project.,0,fa20
Learning new tools.,0,fa20
"My least favorite part of the class might be working on the final project. It's definitely the hardest part of the class for me. I love working with my group, but the work expected from me each week has been slightly overwhelming. With it already being Week 5, I feel like we haven't made much progress, and I'm feeling a lot of pressure. In addition, the final project is so open-ended that it gives us more chances to make more mistakes in our project.",0,fa20
"The quizzes weigh heavy on me because I have used up the free 10 points already and usually, I miss on average 1-3 questions every week, so I am nervous that my grade will continue to drop.",0,fa20
"The quizzes can sometimes have some vague questions, but overall I think the quality of the quizzes is fine and it is just a nitpick. ",0,fa20
the quiz should not set a deadline bc sometimes too busy to finish on time ,0,fa20
"The amount of work, pace of the course, and lack of connection between python notebook and lecture videos/notebooks.",0,fa20
Too many quizzes,0,fa20
Some hard concepts,0,fa20
"the quizzes sometimes have some tricky questions where I am overthinking and think it can be two option choices, and sometimes end up getting it wrong. Regardless, I like the material a lot! ",0,fa20

I'd prefer mandatory quizzes to be optional or for extra credit.,0,fa20
"Some of the quiz question wordings can be a bit vague, but this is very rare. ",0,fa20
It's very easy to lose points. Especially for our final project. I'm confused about how it will be graded.,0,fa20
Nothing so far.,0,fa20
"i think this class is perfect. right speed, good lecture videos. One thing I miss is going to lecture in person but obviously that isnt possible right now.",0,fa20
My LEAST liked part of COGS 108 are the quizzes they are not always reflective of the material taught and ambiguous.,0,fa20
"One attempt per quiz, laptop has died in the middle of a quiz and by the time I was able to go back to the quiz it was a poor score. ",0,fa20
The syntax was went over fairly quickly and I am not sure I would have to remember the syntax. ,0,fa20
Sometimes the quiz answers are confusing and vague (people have mentioned it before on Piazza).,0,fa20

"Github, This is the first time I learn about Github. It sounds so sophisticated to me.",0,fa20
"The part that I liked least about COGS 108 is the process of finding a group for the final project, as it was difficult for me to find group members when people I asked did not seem to respond right away, while also forgetting to clear themselves from the teammate search once they had their group. I did not want to just ask too many different people and just work with whoever responds 1st in 1st come 1st serve type of manner since I felt I'd be disrespectful to those I bothered to ask, so I waited patiently to get responses from people I heard from 1st. Unfortunately, that costed me several days in the process of finding group members.",0,fa20

Missing tooo many points on those video quizzes :(,0,fa20
Taking quizzes for each lecture video,0,fa20
"Course content quizzes. I understand why they're a thing. It gets everyone in the class to watch the lecture videos. But I think the questions on there are way too niche. A lot of the questions don't focus on the general picture of the lectures or sometimes they ask ambiguous questions that may have multiple answers. For example, in one of our recent quizzes, we were asked two questions where we were given scenarios and had to pick the applicable confounding variable. Due to the fact that the question is more qualitative, it is bound to be ambiguous, but I'd be cool if it was a little more clear cut. But then again, it might just be me. ",0,fa20
"the quizzes are not my favorite. they are not that hard, but sometimes I make stupid mistakes, I hope there was more attempts for quizzes. ",0,fa20
"The quizzes. I feel like sometimes the quiz questions are a bit more advanced from lecture, which can be a good thing, but I don't know to expect it right after just watching the lecture.",0,fa20
The quiz is a little bit difficult than expected.,0,fa20
The lecture videos keep getting longer and longer and I don't have a large attention span anymore so I feel like I'm not getting a lot of information from them. I think it would be better to break them up into smaller videos of subtopics.,0,fa20
Nothing to complain about honestly,0,fa20
"I don't like the quizzes. They don't take me that long to complete the quizzes, however even though I take thorough notes, sometimes the questions are ambigious and are hard to answer, so I have missed a lot of points. ",0,fa20
My LEAST liked part of COGS 108 are the quizzes they are not always reflective of the material taught and ambiguous.,0,fa20
I think the project is a very daunting task made even more difficult with how groups are now separated. Being able to find a window within multiple student's schedule in the middle of this pandemic (and political chaos) is extremely difficult.,0,fa20
"The remote nature of the class, but there's nothing we can do about it :(",0,fa20
I was a bit unclear about the individual project proposal when it was initially assigned,0,fa20
"Group project; since this is anonymous, to be honest I wish I could have met and gotten to know my members beforehand rather than basically having to choose at random (based on piazza posts), especially since it counts for such a big part of my grade. It's a bit frustrating and kind of unfair imo. Either that or group projects shouldn't count for this much of the grade. It's hard to think these things through at the beginning of the quarter when deciding.  I also don't like that the class is remote; makes everything feel weird, including for group projects. idk

I accidentally submitted A1 late because I initially had a hard time keeping track of everything via canvass in my classes, so that was annoying, especially since I think I ended up getting everything correct. I don't think that's anyone's fault though, just a frustration on my end.

But otherwise I love the class content and class structure and think it's been very well designed. I wish Professor Ellis had more office hours throughout the week.",0,fa20
I have not really enjoyed having to take a quiz after every lecture video. I personally find having to take 7-10 quizzes a week slightly excessive but I do see the value in taking the quizzes.,0,fa20
"final project, hard to decide what to do and how to begin",0,fa20
There is nothing in particular that I dislike about the class.,0,fa20
Some of the quiz questions are just a test on verbatim.,0,fa20
"The amount of emphasis on ""perfect memory"" for the quizzes. Human error combined with current circumstances kind of make it natural to get less than 95% of all points across all weeks. More ""free points"" or extra quiz questions(similar difficulty, or feedback related, for maybe a couple of points every week) would be helpful.",0,fa20
"The little deductions I get from my assignments, they make me so sad. But I will try my hardest to attend section or office hours to compensate for those small confusions. ",0,fa20
There are no live lectures,0,fa20
Group meeting,0,fa20
What I have liked the least about COGS 108 so far is the group project. Learning the material and completing the assignments on my own is already a lot of work. Having to worry about a different project where you have to depend on other people is too much given the world's current situation and my home environment.,0,fa20
I feel like I haven't had enough time to delve super deep into the topics because of my other classes : (,0,fa20
"Canvas quizzes, It would be better if they were all in one quiz.

Quiz questions' answers are sometimes arbitrary,0,fa20
The quizzes can be pressuring sometimes. ,0,fa20
The pressure of the final project. I am having a hard time to be able to meet with my team and work on the project. I now sort of wish that I worked on the solo project that way I don't feel like I'm bringing my team down or vice versa.,0,fa20
honestly the final project. I don't really feel like there's a lot of instructor input so it is a little difficult to do a lot of outside work but hopefully that is just because we are just starting going through the datasets this week,0,fa20
"One assignment every few weeks. I think I would have preferred mini assignments to solidify class concepts that involved programming, rather than the concept check quizzes, because I feel like I would retain everything a bit better that way. ",0,fa20

I haven't liked the change due dates for Assignments on Datahub,1,wi21
"I enjoy about learning python. I think learning pandas package enable me to clean my data in more efficient way. Also, I achieve a better tool to express my data, when I learned data visualization.",1,wi21
Mainly being able to explore the field of data science and tools to work with and analyze real data out there in the world. I think it's cool to be able to work with the data to be able to deduce interesting stats or facts that are not easily seen without tools.,1,wi21
Coding is funny,1,wi21

Applying skills from COGS18 to real-world scenarios such as experimenting.  My python skills are not being exercised.,1,wi21
"The process. It could be ugly at the start of a assignments, but it comes together and I learn the ins and outs through struggling and trial and error. ",1,wi21
I enjoy learning Python and especially how I can apply that in my future career. It is a new programming language to me as I only know Java so far. But learning Python is helpful and I know more about how scientists can put the data together to answer questions.,1,wi21
"What I have enjoyed the most are the detailed responses from emails. The large amount of feedback is rare to see, and it makes it much easier to stay on the right track for the project.",1,wi21
Love the lectures and the amount of information given during them. It does not seem like it's overwhelming. It feels like the perfect amount :) ,1,wi21
Learning how to use pandas has been incredibly useful for other classes. ,1,wi21
"I enjoyed learning using github, as well as data wrangling. ",1,wi21
I have enjoyed the ethics lectures the most as I think the concepts are extremely important,1,wi21
"I've enjoyed doing the A2 assignment because I thought that one was fairly easy to do, and it felt good when I understood how to write the code.",1,wi21
"I like the hands-on experience I've been getting with Python in relation to its applications with data wrangling and data visualization designs. I feel like having so many opportunities for hands-on learning has really solidified the fundamentals of using Python to perform data analytics, and Prof. Ellis always offers clear, easy-to-understand instruction whenever getting us started on the basics.",1,wi21

"I've enjoyed learning Python and the overall organization of the course. I've been meaning to learn Python for a long time and it's nice to have the chance to both learn and apply it to assignments and projects. In terms of the organization, it's really nice that students know pretty much exactly what to expect week to week as it allows us to plan ahead in relation to other classes as well.",1,wi21
Hands on learning of seaborn and pandas. Also just the idea of fermi estimation (which I will now use for the rest of my life).,1,wi21
"I have most enjoyed the team aspect of COGS 108. As a computer science major, it is refreshing to be able to work with a larger team and be able to hear the thoughts and ideas of many other people. I like that this class revolves around such an interesting project where there is a large amount of flexibility, such as free choice of topic.",1,wi21
"I'm really not a fan of the material, but I like how Prof Ellis walks us through the notebooks and how the coding stuff is explained very clearly. Having the explanations in the class notebooks makes doing the discussion labs and assignments a lot easier since I can usually check the class notebook and reliably find the code I need.",1,wi21
"Professor is always a joy to have in the class, work is spaced out and not too difficult. ",1,wi21
the discussions and hw,1,wi21

I have enjoyed learning how to incorporate coding into data analysis. ,1,wi21
"I have learned a new way to look at data, and had great fun doing research on our project. ",1,wi21
"The group project. I think it is really productive and helpful to feel what group coordination would be like in the real world, like in a job or research prosition.",1,wi21
"The class rhythm is good for me and because there is no midterm and final, it gives me more time to figure out what's the meaning behind each question. I think I can learn more in this way.",1,wi21
I liked exploring ways to represent different visualizations using same dataset and the importance of ethics in data science was intriguing too.,1,wi21
"I enjoyed learning about the different data files, such as CSV, JSON files, and learning about how to use pandas to create different datasets and tables.",1,wi21
"I like the structure of the class and how we work in teams. It makes me feel less stressed in knowing that I have a team to collaborate with this quarter instead of having to do a huge project on my own. I think that even though its through zoom, it offers students the ability to chat and get to know each other in a time where that is limited not only in our social and personal lives but also in school work. I think its a nice break and overall makes me feel more confident in the class.",1,wi21
I have enjoyed the learning of python. I can now easily use this language to analyze data.,1,wi21
"I enjoy learning the python library pandas. I know it is an important skill for data analyze, it is worth to learn in this class since it will be more helpful for my future career!",1,wi21
"I enjoy doing the assignments, it is pretty difficult with no python experience and I am also not great at coding, so it does take a lot of time, but figuring out the code when Iâ€™m stuck can be fun sometimes. ",1,wi21
"Learning about pandas, it is very interesting",1,wi21
"The class is very structured and despite having many assignments, they're all due on Friday every week, so it's easy to remember. ",1,wi21
Learning about ethics in COGS 108 was really interesting for me but I am biased because I love when ethics are involved in anything,1,wi21
I liked learning to do different types of plots using seaborn/matplotlib/pandas,1,wi21
The lecture and homework structure is super clear.,1,wi21
A lot of resources; reasonable amount of workload. ,1,wi21
"The content of the course is really helpful, and I think I actually learn something about how to apply data science.",1,wi21
"The thing I have enjoyed MOST about COGS 108 so far is working on the group project. During this time of remote learning, I believe things like group projects help people feel less isolated and give students an opportunity to better connect with their peers.",1,wi21
I like working with a team and learning from other team members.,1,wi21
I like the pace of lecture and assignments. It's almost a perfect balance of being able to learn a lot at an optimal level without having excessive stress.,1,wi21
I enjoy the option to watch the lectures asynchronously such that I can watch the lectures at my own pace and pause when I need to.,1,wi21

In classes where I have no control over my teammate, I find it very difficult to hold my teammates accountable and thus my grade was affected. I also like the optional discussion/lab. I have learned a lot from the discussion while not having to worry about losing points during the process.",1,wi21
I've enjoyed everything for the most part. I feel like I'm learning a lot in regards to data science and the curriculum is interesting and engaging..,1,wi21
"I enjoyed the amount of time we get to complete the assignments. A lot of us having a lot going on, so it's nice to not be on a time crunch for everything.",1,wi21
The live lectures are really nice,1,wi21
I enjoyed most about how we get to practice the skills that we need in Jupytr notebook. I feel like the assignments and discussion are helpful. ,1,wi21
I'm glad that i learned how to wrangle dataset and create colorful plots to find relationship between numbers and objects.,1,wi21
"Although the most difficult, I have truly enjoyed the Assignments in the class so far. Although we've only done the assignments on the easier end, I've enjoyed tackling each problem, and have found myself surprised at how much I've learned! I really enjoy the open-ended type of questions that allow me to think about what strategies I can use - although the occasional hints are also extremely helpful! ",1,wi21
Learning how to use the different python libraries.,1,wi21
"For a class that has a coding prerequisite, I like how the professor is still taking the time to explain basic concepts instead of rushing right in. Without having a strong coding background, I am still able to follow along most of the times and the pacing allows for slow listeners and slow learners to not fall behind.",1,wi21
"Seeing how I can  use code to find the average  of my data or any other information I need from a data frame is something I have enjoyed. It is pretty neat that I do not have to go through all the data, but instead I can write a  a code that will fetch the data for me. ",1,wi21
"I like that most of the material (python libraries, EDA, and ethics) isn't being made unnecessarily difficult. For me personally and where I'm gauging myself at, just having more exposure to and having the chance to practice these basics? is super helpful. It's encouraging to not be drowning in new material for once. Instead of stressing out learning new things, I get practice with important skills, something that I feel other courses don't offer.",1,wi21
The thing I enjoyed most about COGS108 so far is learning about how to take csv files from websites and making them into datasets. The assignments are very fair,1,wi21
I enjoy programming in Python and trying to plot various data. I have a lot of experience in Python but I do not have that much experience in interpreting and cleaning data like this.,1,wi21
Working with my group members. Establishing new connections.,1,wi21
I enjoy the format and the digestible information is great for people new to data science,1,wi21
Learning Python and web scraping.,1,wi21
Assignments,1,wi21
"I really like the group project and the structure involved in the deadlines and instructions. It feels very structured, and helps us really understand how to structure and communicate to be able to do a project with others and what deadlines are necessary",1,wi21
I enjoy learning about the ability to make data models which I want to use later for Machine Learning,1,wi21
"Really learning about how to question data around the world and the fact that discussion labs, which are a bit more simple compared to assignments, can be used in substitute for final grade. ",1,wi21
Lectures aren't so condensed that both conceptual and technical content (like specific functions) put together. They're also recorded and rarely go over time.,1,wi21
"I think I've enjoyed importing and learning about different uses for python that apply toward data science and analysis in the real world. Prior to this, I had been wondering how exactly my Cogs degree would result in me being able to be qualified in analytical data, so now that we're doing it, it feels pretty satisfying.",1,wi21
Working on the assignments - it's a nice way to get introduced to Python.,1,wi21
"I've largely enjoyed the teaching style. Professor Ellis is very clear with her explanations for the various different aspects of the course, especially when we go over python/pandas/etc.",1,wi21
Making beautiful viz!,1,wi21
HOMEWORK,1,wi21
Working on the group project during this pandemic makes me feel like i am not alone and also going to the OH and chat with the tutors.,1,wi21
learning about python because I didn't know much going in,1,wi21
Doing the Discussion question,1,wi21
I've enjoyed the Assignments the most. I feel like I'm learning as I walk through them.,1,wi21
The clear lectures! They're easy to follow and introduces the topics well.,1,wi21
Learning how to incorporate data science into our lives,0,wi21
"I really did not enjoy learning ethnic part. Although I think it is a very important topic, I still think it is kind of boring. I am glad the rest lectures are amazing and engaging.",0,wi21
"Since I have to say something I guess it'll be that it can be a little confusing to know what exactly the assignments are asking for in some questions, or what specific method it wants us to use and how.",0,wi21
PDF lecture notes should be put on Canvas,0,wi21
"At first, I felt that the Data Ethics or Data Privacy sections were unnecessary. HOWEVER, I soon realized that they are valid concerns because neither I would like my data to be nonconsentially used and these are topics that are often undermined.",0,wi21
final project,0,wi21
PDF lecture notes should be put on Canvas,0,wi21
"The pace, but I understand this is an introductory course, and I did take the course for this reason, so this is not a valid criticism.",0,wi21
Discussion questions being vague,0,wi21
"The difficulty of some packages such as pandas.  Some stuff feel harder than they should, like graphing.",0,wi21
The stress about it all. Thank Goodness there is no test involving executing code ,0,wi21
I cannot think of anything that I like least about COGS 108. Everything seems good so far to me,0,wi21
"This one is hard to say, but I think I least enjoy the discussion section assignments, mainly because the discussion section assignments together tend to take longer than the assignments, which is due to my lack of knowledge in Python, pandas, etc.",0,wi21
"Since I am still not so comfortable with coding, the assignments are still a bit overwhelming. ",0,wi21
The programming skill level varies too much in the class which makes group projects hit or miss. ,0,wi21
in general its just hard for me to grasp coding concepts but thats not specific to this class,0,wi21
"In terms of assignments, I didn't like D3. I wasn't able to extract the topics/code covered in lecture to complete D3 in an efficient way, and I struggled a lot on making the proportions, spending hours on it.",0,wi21
"Lecture examples for data visualization tended to be more simple than for the discussion lab, which resulted in quite some frustration compared to earlier experiences with discussion submissions. I understand that in the beginning of the quarter, we were already warned that we would need to do a lot of Googling (and honestly, I have no complaints about doing so, because I have found the overall research experience to be more enlightening than painstaking), but I feel like the class would have benefitted if more challenging examples had been included in the lecture.   ",0,wi21

Working with my group has been a little frustrating given that we are all remote and disconnected. At times they can be quite unresponsive.,0,wi21
"Length and helpfulness of technical discussion sections. It would be more helpful if instead of going over previously written code (like the D3 Baby names), the TA's actually coded in Pandas/seaborn in front of us, this would help us see the process more clearly.",0,wi21
"I have least liked the timed quizzes that we must take each Friday. While they do encourage us to go over the material and solidify our understanding of the lectures, I think they shouldn't be timed as 15 minutes to take a quiz online can sometimes be stressful.",0,wi21
"Again, I really am not interested in data science in general so it's been kind of hard to keep myself motivated for this class (especially when the COGS department won't let us P/NP like other departments have been doing, but that's a whole other can of worms...). But I don't have anything I dislike in particular about the way the course is run, and I'm grateful that even though there are quite a few small assignments every week, none of them feel like busy work and are actually helpful for me since I'm not as strong with coding.",0,wi21
Everything is doing great! ,0,wi21
this final project,0,wi21
documentation on programming pandas can be difficult to apply to assignment,0,wi21
I find that the discussions are quite long and can be rather tedious. I think shortening them to a more clear cut practice would serve to be better. ,0,wi21
"There are a lot of new terminologies and when I was doing technical discussion, a lot of stuff was barely covered in the class, hence it was a little bit stressful. ",0,wi21
"I think I would like discussions and Assignments to be combined, because to me it feels like there are too many different things due to keep track of.",0,wi21
Discussion 3 is somewhat difficult for me. There is one question taking me about 2 hours but I still miss it.,0,wi21
D3 was too hard to complete as it did not have much guidance given that it is supposed to help us with assignments. A2 was way easier than D3.,0,wi21
"I least enjoyed the actual coding and programming aspects of using pandas, as it can get a little confusing learning the syntax and code.",0,wi21
The thing I like the least is probably having so many things due on Fridays. It bunches up for me and its managable but it wouldnt have been my preference to have everything due on one day. But maybe having 2/3 due on friday and one due on saturday or sunday since I work during the week and the weekend has more study and homework time for me.,0,wi21
"I know that the ethics are important for data analysis, but it is kind of boring. Also, I am so confused that I missed some points in every quiz.",0,wi21
Every topics are interesting! No liked LEAST so far in this class.,0,wi21
I think doing a group project makes this class a little difficult because itâ€™s hard to find time for the group to meet because everyone has very conflicting schedules. ,0,wi21
"Early lecture, not a morning person lol",0,wi21
"I honestly don't like that I have to work in a group of four, but at least I get more experience with collaboration :)",0,wi21
"Coding as always been hard for me and this class is no different, so as coding gets more complicated I have to spend more and more time on this class and it ends up being the most difficult and time consuming. ",0,wi21
"Everything is good, it's just hard to get up at 9 in the morning :)",0,wi21
Remote learning makes the group communication a little harder than usual.,0,wi21
It'd be great if we spent more time talking about python ,0,wi21
"Actually there is nothing I do not like, this course is great.",0,wi21
"The thing I liked LEAST about COGS 108 so far is learning about all the different things that can be done in pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. I'm overwhelmed by how many different things can be done and don't think I can remember everything we go over in lecture.",0,wi21
Plotting graphs is hard.,0,wi21
"The Discussion notebooks are sometimes confusing from the lack of instructions on the notebook itself, but through lectures and research they are doable.",0,wi21
I find the assignments to be a little challenging and could take some time to complete with no prior python knowledge.,0,wi21
The Discussion problems are sometimes unclear or cover material that has not yet been taught.,0,wi21
Sometimes I find the Discussion assignments and the actual assignments difficult to do and stressful and I feel like I do not have enough knowledge from the class lectures to be able to answer the questions.,0,wi21
"This is less of a dislike, and more of me being bad at the utilization of python, pandas and other imports. It has gotten easier (likely due to previous experience with java) though, so it is not that bad!",0,wi21
"What I like least is just that there's never a right or wrong answer in some instances. I guess this could be a good thing, but in some cases I find myself doing a lot of outside research to understand something new that I have to learn to apply.",0,wi21
"I am not a fan of coding and am a beginner Python learner, which do not go well together. I have had to look basically everything up for the Discussion and normal Assignments, so it has been sometimes very frustrating and time-consuming, even when I do go to office hours/section for help.",0,wi21
"The data visualization teaching portion could use some work. I really struggled with D3 on how to wrangle the data into a usable format to display. I attended lectures and you went over some of it but it was nowhere near enough for the discussion lab. I also attended two different TA's office hours but neither was able to help too much. They both seemed just as lost as I was with the errors I encountered and were unable to effectively guide me on alternate strategies. If the time spent teaching data-wrangling strategies was increased before dropping us into the lab or more guide rails were added to the lab to help us, that would make the experience much better as our support structure wasn't able to prop us up and google isn't particularly helpful as the error messages are very generic and nondescriptive of the true nature of the error.",0,wi21
Class is too early,0,wi21
"The least I've liked about COGS 108 is just realizing just how much memorization is required in cleaning, wrangling, and visualizing data. I'm not only trying to memorize the syntax for Python, but I'm also struggling with remembering what functions to call in pandas and how to correctly type out the operation I want. I spent 3 hours trying to google how to run just one cell and I still never figured it out. It is quite a lot to keep track of and I know the only way to get better is practice practice practice! No matter what though, I'm super excited to be learning these tools and it's great to know that this knowledge will be useful for me in the long run! 

Also, the quizzes are not my favorite. I have watched the lecture videos twice sometimes and I still cannot get full points on the quizzes.",0,wi21
Learning how to use Python,0,wi21
"Because I live in a different time zone and have a tight schedule for when I can watch friday lecture, it is difficult for me to apply things that are mentioned in friday lecture to my assignments/group project. It would be nice if most of the tips and advice could be concentrated into monday and wednesday lecture. But all in all it's been really great, this is very minute :)",0,wi21
"I'm still working on adjusting to GitHub since I haven't had prior experience with it, so having it as a vital part of the course is a little challenging.",0,wi21
"I don't really like the weakly quiz, although it's not really hard, but i still would miss 1 or 2 points on weekly quizzes",0,wi21
"I do not like the assignments, due to my difficulty with them on my own.",0,wi21
"The group project, this is because although I understand it is necessary of an experience for the future, it is still difficult to manage a project all online, while still trying to be understanding of other group-mate's personal situations and responsibilities.",0,wi21
I don't really like the weekly quizzes. I feel like they don't accurately assess what I have learned from that week.,0,wi21
It's difficult to learn and apply a lot of the topics we've learned in class to our projects due to the fast-paced nature of the class. ,0,wi21
Lecture talking speed a little too fast,0,wi21
The quizzes just seem like busywork. I think the assignments help my learning significantly more because actively doing something helps me learn better than taking quizzes.,0,wi21
I think the quizzes are pretty stressful for me each week even though I watches each lecture on time.,0,wi21
"Not a huge fan of the assignments, I feel like I know the gist of what I have to do but then I do it and it ends up being wrong! I think i'm just not that confident with python so was hoping for a little more guidance.",0,wi21
"I don't necessarily have anything that I like the least. I feel like I personally do a lot more googling in this class than I have had to in cogs 18. However, I believe it's because this class is less oriented in learning about code and more about doing actual data science.",0,wi21
"Figuring out how to graph was pretty hard. I kept getting errors with the parameters in seaborn. For example, I would try to pass something into the column but it would be the wrong column so my graph would look weird. Once I did figure it out though, it was very nice to see but the steps before are very frustrating.",0,wi21
The coding. The prerequisite for this class is one python class (which I took) and I feel wholly unprepared for the material in this class.,0,wi21
"Dealing with the submission system on DataHub. I wish there were more confirmations/acknowledgement of my submission that would give me more confidence that my work has been submitted successfully, currently there is little user feedback.",0,wi21
Homework,0,wi21
"Honestly, I've got nothing for this! Thanks for a great quarter so far (:",0,wi21
The homework is a little overload.,0,wi21
the discussions can be hard and the quizzes as well. Sometimes lectures don't really explain concepts introduced in the assignments or discussions too well. There are a lot of assignments due each week.,0,wi21
"Nothing, I like everything about the class so far",0,wi21
Keep procrastinating watching lectures led to more to watch...,0,wi21
the bugs I run into while trying to code for the hmw and trying to figure those things out,0,wi21
"Mm, nothing much. Maybe do more backflips during lecture? I'm just kidding, I'm thoroughly enjoying this course. ",0,wi21
The office hour is hard to reach since I am at different time zone.,0,wi21
"I've gotten frustrated with myself a couple times with either an assignment or workbook, but I know that's just what comes with being new to a programming language",0,wi21

"Fixing technical errors with Jupyter notebooks and Github, git controls",0,wi21
"I still think that the ethics are a little bit boring, although they are important.",0,wi21
"I'm not sure if it's by design, but I feel like I don't know enough about how to use pandas, seaborn, etc., by the end of lectures, and end up spending a lot of time on discussion labs and assignments. (Maybe the lecture is for the theory and labs are for application?)",0,wi21
The coding aspect of this course is by far the hardest and most frustrating thing of this course.  ,0,wi21
"The thing I liked the least is doing Discussion labs and assignments. I know they are supposed to help me practice so that I can do better for my project, but I felt like what we need to do for the labs and assignment are much more harder/advanced than what we learned in class. I had a really hard time trying to figure out D3. I tried watching technical discussion recording, going to a technical discussion, and going to the project discussion (I was waiting in the waiting room but ended up leaving because of my other schedule), but I wasn't able to get enough help / get enough idea on how to do some parts of D3.",0,wi21
maybe the quiz,0,wi21
"The process of creating our project topic, it is so hard and our team spend so many time thinking our topic. ",0,wi21
"It's pretty fast paced and I haven't worked too much with Python before so it's a little difficult, but not unbearable. ",0,wi21
"Rather than being something I dislike, it is overwhelming having more than one technology (Pandas & Seaborn) but that's normal. It's a lot more self-study than I expected.",0,wi21
"Waking up at 9am, quizzes because I keep getting 1 or so questions wrong",0,wi21
"Much of the assignments feel like information I've been taught in previous classes such as basic pandas, but I understand that that is probably necessary for many students.",0,wi21
What I have liked least is the stuff to do with github because I am not familiar with it so it is still a little confusing. ,0,wi21
Finding the data for our project,0,wi21
"The discussion assignments, I often feel like they are harder than the actual assignments and it's hard to prioritize discussion assignments when they aren't mandatory/I don't have time in the week to work on it for a few hours",0,wi21

The assignment because it is kind of a lot and hard for me since I don't have much python experiences before.,0,wi21
Assignments,0,wi21
I don't like the discussion assignments. I have a really hard time trying to figure out how to do them even after office hours.,0,wi21
"I feel like the D# (D1, D2, etc) should be more basic/ tutorial style, because the only point of these are to teach and help understand rather than test knowledge (like the A# and Q# should). If the D# had more hints or more explicit about how to solve the problem, that would be extremely helpful.",0,wi21
"As I am pretty unfamiliar with pandas, the discussions have been a bit harder for me, but this may also be due to the fact that I'm not able to access the discussion recordings.",0,wi21
"Although I enjoy making the visualizations, I don't have a strong foundation in python or programming skills, so it has been frustrating getting used to the syntax, processes and general logistics of it. ",0,wi21
The thing I liked the least is having to coordinate group times with everyone because it is a bit challenging to coordinate times virtually.,0,wi21
"The weight of each assignment and components of the project are stressful and overwhelming because they are worth a significant percent of my grade and unlike discussions and quizzes, it hard to be assured that I did it well and/or get quick feedback.",0,wi21
"I like quizzes the least. They are good markers to make sure students are on track with the materials but the questions require more thinking. So, I stress on them a bit more than I should for a check up assignment.",0,wi21
"I prefer piazza to CampusWire, but I am slowly getting the hang of it",0,wi21
trying to find a group ,0,wi21
I have not enjoyed the quizzes too much as I feel it would be better if we could earn back the points we lose in some way. This is due to some earlier quizzes having trickier questions but it is reasonable as the loss isn't too large. The quiz questions are fine as they do just ask largely about things one should know straight from lecture notes and recordings.,0,wi21
"I have disliked the fact that a lot of technical code related things are glossed over â€” even after having taken cogs 18 it really feels like this is a class meant for CS majors. Given that itâ€™s a cogs major requirement, I think catering more to cogs majors makes sense.",0,wi21

"For me personally, it has been the pace of the class. I understand that it's hard to accommodate everyone, especially since the class has a wide variety of majors and programming experience. I just feel like the class has been moving a bit too slowly.

The different graph. ,0,wi21
The assignment deadlines are lining up with other class assignment deadlines but that is all. ,0,wi21
"The fact that we have to come up with the project proposal (which essentially also means already having a particular dataset, etc in mind preemptively) before we've learned much about the type of analysis we'll be doing.",0,wi21
I don't really understand lecture since it's usually large blocks of code and we go through them quickly rather than breaking down each code line. I also don't like how most of the topics in discussion lab are not in lecture and I feel like I have to google most of it to understand. ,0,wi21
"Learning these modules is real confusing... Like I understand a good amount of python, but I can't wrap my head around the data manipulations and plotting stuff. Still feel like I need a ton more help and it's making me very stressed about making progress on my project, since there's so much I want to do but I just can't because I don't know how to go about starting.",0,wi21
"Lecture can be a little dense/fast sometimes. Occasionally, professor will take time and carefully express how a certain function works and gives multiple examples of different uses; other times she breezes through a function and gives a general idea of how it works, this results in many students (at least the ones I have communicated with) investing a large sum of time figuring out how to use certain functions during each and every assignment so far.",0,wi21
Vaguely worded options in quizzes,0,wi21
"The materials are getting scarier by lecture. The amount of new stuff is a little overwhelming to me, especially when applying them in the discussion labs and upcoming assignments, as well as for the final project. I worry that my performance won't be as satisfactory as I'd hope. It's also extremely time consuming to me because of my limited knowledge, but whenever I get it it's the best feeling.",0,wi21
the coding aspect is a lil overwhelming ,0,wi21
Sometimes I feel like quiz material is not covered in the lectures or is very detailed so it's hard to remember. I take notes on majority of the content and sometimes I still can't recall/find it.,0,wi21
"Some of the discussion labs were very challenging for someone with essentially no experience with the analysis packages, also Assignment 2 was due after Lab 3, but lab 3 required skills learned from assignment 2 which was confusing.",0,wi21

"Assignment is too straight forward (solutions are almost given), maybe having weekly problem set without specific approach would better promote self-learning.",0,wi21
I think the least I like about this class is that there's a lot of coding but not too much detail on how to do it. I often find myself looking up how to use functions in order to complete the discussion labs and assignments. ,0,wi21

"Overall I really enjoy the class but what I think the thing I like the least has more to do with coding than it actually has to do with the class. I've taken a bunch of CS courses before this class but I think pandas in general just irritates me because I'm so unused to it. I understand how to solve the problems and what the end goal should be, but I find that it can be really annoying without knowing the right code to use along with not knowing what exactly to look up when I'm stuck.",0,wi21
Probably the discussions as they are sometimes ambiguous and I'm unsure of what to put in for my answers sometimes.,0,wi21
I have liked the least working with GitHub. This is more of a personal issue because it is my first time using it and I am very unfamiliar. I understand the terms and what I am supposed to do but get confused on how to carry out what I want to.,0,wi21
The lecture quizzes because at the end of the week I forget about the small details mentioned in class so I have to rewatch everything to pick up anything missing. ,0,wi21
The discussion quizzes. I feel like they are a bit harder than the HW,0,wi21
Difficult to get a hang of syntax etc for discussion assignments.,0,wi21
"I've liked the discussion labs the least, but that does not mean I don't enjoy them. I feel that they vary in difficulty too much and are quite unclear on what's exactly wanted, which makes them less enjoyable compared to the assignments. A suggestion from me would be to make the instructions slightly more clear on what's wanted, and I believe that will make the labs more enjoyable.",0,wi21
Discussions and Assignments are quite challenging. It would be beneficial for us to take more time learning programming rather than logics.,0,wi21
There's nothing I disliked about COGS108 thus far. The only thing I could nitpick would be that the assignment and labs can be a bit difficult at times if you don't show up to the lab sections.,0,wi21
Homework is a little bit hard (datahub); still very worried about the final project since we think our proposal is not good and it is difficult to find data that we want and determine our research question,0,wi21
"If I had to pick, the part I've liked the least about COGS 108 was when we had to conceptually learn about github, privacy, ect. I like the coding aspect of this class more than the conceptual one so it was harder for me to focus on the concepts. On the other hand, I do recognize that they are important so I knew they were necessary to learn.",0,wi21
The teach speaks a little too fast,0,wi21
"minimal instructions in discussions. I liked how A2 guides you and you learn a lot, whereas discussion is just less vague and you don't really know where to start if you're stuck.",0,wi21
"however, sometimes working with a group needs way more effort",0,wi21
"Not about the course but python itself, it was kinda confusing and hard to understand the logic at first since I have not learned it before this course, and it is pretty different from the languages I am familiar with (C++, java).",0,wi21
The incovinient caused by online courses make it difficult to communicate with group members.,0,wi21
There are some quiz problem that prof just mentioned ambiguously on class and I think it should be some more technical problem.,0,wi21
Not getting feedback for our project idea sooner.,0,wi21
Nothing. I am having a blast. Thank you,0,wi21
"I don't like waking up early in the morning for lecture, but I have to because I liked being in lecture live.",0,wi21
I want to learn more on how to use Github because I am still not comfortable using them.,0,wi21
"I definitely have struggled a little with the discussion labs - the assignments are fine because the instruction is detailed, but even after watching the discussions I can't figure a lot out. This is also the first very hands on course I've had at UCSD with doing my own research so it has been hard believing in myself and my abilities when it is something out of my comfort zone that I don't have experience with. But nonetheless I am very excited to get more involved in this class!",0,wi21
Groups,0,wi21
Lectures go a little fast.,0,wi21
"Knowing that COGS 108 was an intro to data science, I knew that we were going to be going really fast through some of the topics. I would love to have spent more time going over pandas syntax and tools and tips for effective data wrangling.",0,wi21
The consistent amount of assignments,0,wi21
"That it's at 9am! ;) On a serious note, there isn't anything I haven't liked about Cogs 108 so far",0,wi21
Working in groups. Very hard to coordinate meeting together. Not easy being productive on a large group project when being remote. ,0,wi21
I wish we had a midterm of sorts to synthesize the content so far,0,wi21
somehow I don't have any particular thing that I've liked the least,0,wi21
"The discussion labs, I feel like they just are a simplified version of assignments which don't necessarily add anything to my skillset",0,wi21
Discussion labs are a little bit harder than expected. I spent a lot of time on doing them.,0,wi21
The documentation for PANDAS sucks.,0,wi21
"So far the discussions take me significantly longer than the assignments. I wish I had learned all of the syntax that I need for discussions either in lecture or in a discussion guide, as most of the times I have to Google everything which takes a while depending on if I know what I'm looking for.",0,wi21
I have liked least about COGS108 assignments and discussion labs because most of them are not covered during the lectures.,0,wi21
Mainly scared for finding datasets for our question and thinking that we should slightly modify our question based off this weeks lecture. I sorta think ours is a little vague and could be specified. ,0,wi21
The struggles and challenges of working as a team.,0,wi21
Nothing really course is not as high stress but more learning involved which is good. Maybe more lecture notes describing content in detail,0,wi21
"I don't like using many different platforms,  so campuswire is a bit annoying for me. I've never understood why we need canvas/piazza/campuswire/etc.",0,wi21
"Sometimes I feel lost in the immense data that is provided to us and I feel that I'm having a hard to honing down to a particular question that I want to solve (for the project) that at the same time, is also answerable with data.",0,wi21
"The assignments, I just take a long time completing assignments, but that's just because I struggle with coding.",0,wi21
"The discussion sections have gotten pretty long, but I like that we can check our answers after.",0,wi21
"I wish we could get more help through a system like autograder, but that might be a personal preference. ",0,wi21
Too many backgrounds and concerns on data analysis,0,wi21
I have liked everything in this course about equally so far. I find all the topic covered interesting and useful. I am not bored with anything. ,0,wi21
I personally do not like how much time I spend on the discussion assignments. I spend a lot of time trying to understand the question and then trying to solve it but its been very time consuming.,0,wi21
"The first few lectures were a bit slow for me, mainly because I already knew a lot of topics introduced at the start",0,wi21
Probably all of the time I spend debugging my code haha,0,wi21
I feel like lectures move a bit too fast. It's always one thing to the next without much explanation. Also discussion sessions I feel like a pretty useless,0,wi21
"Well, I'm not a great/well-versed coder so naturally, I don't like the coding part, but it's still fun to learn I just wish I had more time to absorb the information",0,wi21
I think it's pretty good,0,wi21
"I think figuring out as a team what to approach for our project was difficult. We had directions we were interesting in heading towards, but had to really figure out which ones would yield a significant enough perspective, which had data sets that could give us ample information, etc. I am excited to get rolling though now that we have our research question!",0,wi21
My least favorite part of COGS108 is the submitting process on datahub. I'm constantly forgotting to submit my assignments and have to revisit the page after I finish (assuming I remember),0,wi21
"Least of all - I don't really like weekly quizzes, but i understand why we need them",0,wi21
"I dislike that we have multiple things due every week. E.g. quiz, hw, discussion.",0,wi21
i like it,0,wi21
Hardest part about this class is learning command line to push and pull repo. ,0,wi21
Everything is very new and tough. Takes a lot of time to learn the concepts,0,wi21
"I like that all the deadlines are on the same day, but I do feel like it's a lot of work each week when balancing 3 other demanding classes too.",0,wi21
Nothing in particular. The pace is a bit fast but I am learning a lot.,0,wi21
not knowing where the project is headed yet gives me some anxiety,0,wi21
completing the assignments and labs ,0,wi21
The vague expectation for the final project's group works.,0,wi21
Discovering A2 was basically a precursor to a lot of what I couldn't quite wrap my head around in D3.,0,wi21
"Sometimes it's hard to wake up for this class in the morning, so I can't always attend synchronously like I would prefer",0,wi21
The least I have liked about COGS108 is that its online and one doesn't necessarily get the help they need in person (which can be more clear). Overall I think this course has done great job in making up for that which is good.,0,wi21
"Github, but that could just be that I might not still understand how to use it",0,wi21
I do not like the discussions too much because it is a little too open-ended and can sometimes be really difficult to answer some of the questions. D3 was one where it was very hard because I had to wait until Friday's lecture to do some of the questions more easily.,0,wi21
"Honestly, I don't find much of if non-enjoyable. ",0,wi21
"Using github to work on the project. Only because our group meets up over discord and works on it together, so github doesn't really facilitate all of us working on a document together. But I'm sure it'll be more useful as we make smaller changes to the document. ",0,wi21
The Lab Assignment is a little bit difficult sometimes.,0,wi21
im melting,0,wi21
What I liked least about COGS 108 is really nothing. I think this class is pretty well prepared during the online era of college. I enjoyed everything about this class so far.,0,wi21
The weekly quizzes. I've been going to all the lectures and I still struggle with them.,0,wi21
I find it hard to get other people in my group to work on a group project when our only form of communication is online. ,0,wi21
"Sometimes in the weekly discussions, the instructions are a little vague so I have to spend more time finding out exactly what I need to do or ask other people who to interpret the question.",0,wi21
The discussions because I have trouble usually with knowing the right way to solve them.,0,wi21
"Sometimes, the I feel like I don't have the appropriate knowledge to solve coding problems on the assignment and feel frustrated.",0,wi21
"I don't like working with my group. It's awkward, I try to talk to them but they're all hesitant to share their thoughts. So I unintentionally became the team lead in order to get things done. My teammates are still putting in the work though. Also I think that they don't attend lecture so they're unfamiliar with Github, etc. so more of editing the files fall onto me, which I'm okay with but it would be nice if the technical skills were more evenly dispersed in my group. ",0,wi21
"I don't have many complaints, but the assignments are frustrating at times as with any coding. ",0,wi21
I feel like the group work has been a lot less exciting than I was hoping for. This would be my first project class so maybe I just don't really have a very accurate expectation. ,0,wi21
"I don't feel that the Technical Discussion have been super helpful for the Discussion assignments. For D3, the TA/IA leading the section I went to just spent most of class walking through Babynames, so I didn't really get to ask any questions about D3.",0,wi21
"Occasionally one of the assignments will have a vague question and it's hard to tell if I answered it as was intended, or sometimes I've already done something in a workbook that I'm asked for later and I don't know whether to remove it from where I did it on my own first and move it there, make a note about it, etc. The workload is pretty heavy on a weekly basis compared to most of my other classes, but that's both a pro and a con for me since I do enjoy the material.",0,wi21
The documentation for various Python functions can be arcane.,0,wi21
"The group project is not as interesting as I thought, it was hard to find a good research question",0,wi21
"I don't like the quizzes system. I think it is probably because I am frustrated from missing one of the quizzes by accident and losing that part of the grade. I think the assignments are useful  and do a good job to make sure that students are on top of the material week by week, so I don't understand the purpose of the quiz.",0,wi21
"I Don't like how many of the lecture and learning materials are in different places, such as GitHub, Datahub, and Canvas",0,wi21
The syntax. Plus Ive been spending too long on discussions,0,wi21
"Lack of guidance in project - it's not clear which TA will be supervising our project or if we are on the general path for producing a 'good' project. I recognize this stance may be hasty in judgement, as we will be getting reponses to our Final Project Proposals soon.",0,wi21
What I have least liked about COGS 108 so far is mainly the group work. I do not mean to be mean but the work feels like its just a 1 week break and then do something for a half a day and then next week or next next week and i think that is fine but i forget a lot.,0,wi21
"The discussion assignments are confusing to me. I find it difficult to do the discussion assignments even after watching lectures and reviewing the discussion section video. I find that it takes up too much time to complete, and I could be focusing on other assignments that are due the same day such as the quiz or assignment/group project.",0,wi21
"Coordinating group project stuff because of having to resolve various schedule conflicts, especially since I have a job outside of school",0,wi21
The lab/DI work we do each week doesn't do much to aid learning as there is little guidance. Assignments seem to be better at this.,0,wi21
The discussion labs are sometimes challenging,0,wi21
There is nothing that I dislike :),0,wi21
"Really like the class, wish it was in person.",0,wi21
"I think that if the lectures were a little more geared towards the Discussion and the Assignments for this class, it would be ideal. I find myself a little confused on the wording of the questions within the worksheets and problems of the homework due at times, especially also the failure of assertions to work on problems (e.g. the 1950 until now question in Discussion 4) confuses me at times.",0,wi21
I least liked some of the difficult questions on the assignments that I couldn't fully grasp through past lecture information and having to rely on searching the web.,0,wi21
"It is alright at the moment, just feels like theres plenty to keep track of.",0,wi21
None. I'm certain that every lecture is very useful and meaningful. ,0,wi21
I feel python is a little bit challenging.,0,wi21
I dislike doing the quizzes. I wish the assignments and discussions would replace the quizzes.,0,wi21
"I think the Term Project could use a bit of more guidence, I feel like it is rarely talked about in class",0,wi21
dicussion,0,wi21
that groupby specific question in D3 cuz I couldn't figure it out,0,wi21
"Despite having background experience in Java, the discussion labs and assignments can still be a bit confusing. I think this is naturally me just trying to learn something new though.",0,wi21
"The Discussion assignments, feel much more tedious than need to be ",0,wi21
The assignments (mostly A2) have felt fairly dense and difficult to complete (however this may be due to my lack of experience with programming/data analysis).,0,wi21
"This will probably have to be my group. After 4 weeks, I feel like 2 of the group members are dead weight. Either they don't contribute or they write like minimal effort/thought sentences, which will require us to redo the sections for them. As a result, despite having 5 people, it's more like 3 individuals doing all the work. Furthermore, at least for me, I think even if they don't do anything, it's definitely harder to focus when you know that you're somewhat carrying other student who simply don't seem to care.",0,wi21
COGS108 is my favorite class this quarter. I really do not have much to complain at the moment.,0,wi21
"What I've liked least is that the discussions feel really hard, while the homeworks feel pretty easy. I find myself lost often on the discussion.",0,wi21
"I mostly just dislike having to get up for class at 9am, but that's pretty much it. The coding is stressful, but it always is for is so it's nothing new.",0,wi21
Kind of wish there was more of a chance for interaction besides in our groups.,0,wi21
The note in jupytr notebook are sometimes hard to read. ,0,wi21
"I feel there're some functions of pandas and seaborn that i'm not familiar with, so i need to spend relatively longer time to learn in order to wrap them up and deal with discussion assignments. I also hope we could have more iclicker questions to practice.",0,wi21
"Occasionally, I feel as though the lectures utilize a few methods that could be a little more explained, especially for students (like me) who have minimal experience with Python - this particularly goes for Data Viz concepts. However, I understand this could be simply a lack of understanding on my part, but if we could somehow get a type of reference sheet with Data Viz functions and differences between packages, it'd be really helpful! ",0,wi21
I'm not sure if I dislike anything.,0,wi21
"There are some aspects of the code being used that has not been explained or brought up in lecture, and I many times find myself googling very simple things but with different websites giving me different definitions. Would be helpful if there was some standardized reference sheet for syntax.",0,wi21
The assignments. They can get very tedious and frustrating. It can become really difficult sometimes to understand why the code does not pass an assert or why it raises an error.,0,wi21
"I wish there were more optional readings/materials. More exposure would really help these topics ""settle"" for me!",0,wi21
The discussion assignments are much more difficult and pretty vague. ,0,wi21
"The different types of plots have been something that I have not been enjoying. I have worked with different plots before in a stats class, but interpreting and nailing the difference between each of the different types is something I'm not entirely used to yet.",0,wi21
The weekly quizzes. I feel like they are not helpful.,0,wi21
"I think the topics are really interesting, but I would like more of an emphasis on how to perform a data science project with regards to a data sci project in industry. I think the project could be more rigorous as I would like to be able to use this project  as an opportunity to promote my data science skills",0,wi21
So far I find the course very interesting and there isn't anything I particularly dislike.,0,wi21
Discussions (they are very hard),0,wi21
"The weekly quizzes, cause there is always 1 question that I can never be sure what the answer is cause I'm a little confused on the phrasing of the question or which answer is being desired, so it just slightly bothers me",0,wi21
I do not like the constant stressing over one question,0,wi21
"Although this cannot be avoided, the fast pace of utilizing python is my only ""complaint"". Coming from a person who had never coded in python before, it was difficult learning the basics and applying learnings from class. Another inevitable fact is that I need to take this course this quarter, which happened to be a very challenging time for both education and my mental health. Other than that, I cannot think of any legitimate complaints!",0,wi21
"I think technical contents aren't really covered in lectures, so it takes a lot more of our own research time to look up functions covered in the discussions. It would be a lot more helpful if lectures could cover at least some content for discussion as it could further reinforce our familiarity with functions that we would probably use in our final project.",0,wi21
"I think what I've liked least about COGS 108 so far is our group project. With the pandemic and varying time zones it is very difficult for all of us to convene at a  specific time, and because of that some members feel pressured to put in work before meetings than they have to. This results at an inherent imbalance in work distribution, which doesn't necessarily occur out of any malicious intent, but rather self preservation.",0,wi21
Working on the group project - I do not enjoy working in groups.,0,wi21
"The adjustment to using python has been a bit of a struggle, as I am largely used to using java. Yet, this isn't a great deterrent to the course as it is a learning opportunity.",0,wi21
"coding and doing the projects.  process of writing codes are too struggling for me, and the topic the project of my group is hard for me to fully understand. Honest talk, Sorry..",0,wi21
Nothing really,0,wi21
All the office hour is kinda early in my time zone.,0,wi21
"My project group, which seems to have abandoned me",0,wi21
The process for figuring out the problems,0,wi21
"I don't learn a lot from the discussion sections, and it always feels like there's not enough time to cover everything. ",0,wi21
The discussion sections have been a bit vague for me and I often struggle with getting through it. ,0,wi21
The amount of coding :/,1,sp21
Learning the basics of python,1,sp21
The assignments are really helpful in practicing python skills,1,sp21
the professor's enthusiasm- it makes watching the lectures fun,1,sp21
the assignment and the lab; able to practice using python,1,sp21
"I enjoyed working on the datahub assignments, they give good practical skills",1,sp21
"What I've enjoyed the most about COGS 108 has been the overall subject matter. This is one of my first upper division courses, and just being able to work and learn about a subject which isn't something simply required or foundational for my other courses is very liberating.",1,sp21
I think the assignments and discussion labs helped me a lot in reviewing the content!,1,sp21
Learning to blend coding with research/analytical thinking.,1,sp21
Live Jupyter notebook demonstrations using interesting examples! Helps me learn in an interactive way.,1,sp21
Group Project which we have to work very hard with our teammates.,1,sp21
I enjoyed the lectures and the mini clicker questions on Zoom.,1,sp21
Learning how to use Pandas,1,sp21
utilizing functions learned from class to solve my assignments.,1,sp21
Weekly discussion practices! Plus the option to be walked through it because otherwise I'd spend many hours on them. It helps keep on top of the coding development throughout the quarter while lectures are very concept based and the code skimmed over is getting progressively more complicated.,1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the pacing of the lectures, and Professor Ellis's teaching style during the lectures.",1,sp21
I think I have enjoyed the labs the most as they provide the most insight regarding the course.,1,sp21
"I have enjoyed learning about data visualization and analysis so much because it can be so applicable to me in a research setting when trying to preprocessing data, visualizing the data, and analyzing the data with EDA. I also like the consistent checkups on our group projects.",1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the project component of COGS 108 the most so far. Thinking of a meaningful research question and then planning out how I and my group would go about answering that question is something I find rewarding. I've wanted to conduct independent investigations of data for a while now, but lacking a structured way to do it has partly held me back. Thankfully, I've been able to leverage some of the COGS 108 material about drafting a research question to achieve this goal.",1,sp21
I enjoyed meeting with my groups. Gives me a chance to talk to others since with covid it gets pretty hard to meet new people,1,sp21
I enjoy the lecture contents. I enjoy learning about GitHub as I am much more comfortable with it now compared to the beginning of the class.,1,sp21
"This is my first data science class so all these new concepts are very interesting to me. I like how all duedates are on friday, which makes it super easy to remember what I have to do for this class. All the resources on Github repo and the templates for our final project are also very helpful. Since it is a big project, its nice that we have a lot of guidance and resources to go for help",1,sp21
I enjoy learning how to read the data and draw conclusions using python and pandas.,1,sp21
Being able to better learn how to create visualizations using data from CSV files,1,sp21
I have enjoyed the assignments the most so far because they are a great way to use the skills we learn in class in an applicable setting.,1,sp21
Seeing how there's coding behind data analysis and that there is code out there that does most of the work for us,1,sp21
Using example data to analyze in class to demonstrate concepts and practices. It really helps me understand how and why we are doing certain things with the data,1,sp21
"How to identify the ethic on the the problem and data set we picked, I enjoyed this the most is because it answered the question I had for a long time.",1,sp21
"I wanted to learn Pandas for a long time, and learning it in this class is great.",1,sp21
"I have enjoyed learning about pandas the most. I understand its usefulness and appeal to SWE recruiters, and thus I am grateful that I have been able to learn a bit of it.",1,sp21
I really enjoying working on the coding labs and assignments! pandas is super cool to use and I'm happy I am starting to become more familiar with the methods used. I find it super fun especially compared to my work from other classes.,1,sp21
The lectures are engaging and interesting; definitely one of my more enjoyable classes.,1,sp21
how helpful the TAs have been with the lab assignments. I get lost a lot so having their help is amazing.,1,sp21
The fact that it is project based and that the main assignment due dates are each two weeks a part from each other. This makes it way easier to balance this class with my other classes and not feel rushed in my work.,1,sp21
"The discussions since they are really hands on, and if I get stuck I can refer to the technical discussion, so they are fun!",1,sp21
The satisfaction of finally figuring out code that works! This is the best feeling,1,sp21
"First class back programming in years after my hiatus, so it has been interesting attempting to crash course some python while not having extremely difficult coding problems, and instead using it in more practical situations. Plus this is my first real data related class which is what I eventually would like to end up doing so it is exciting (aside from the pressures of school/life).",1,sp21
"I guess the organization of this class, this has been the best class i had during remote learning in terms of structure. I LOVE that the due dates are all on friday ranging from quizzes, labs, hw, and project stuff. It keeps me organized since I've been using my planner more this quarter.",1,sp21
"Maybe the lecture, because data science is new to me, and I feel I learned a lot in every lecture.",1,sp21
The technical discussions are really helpful for me to complete the discussion assignments.,1,sp21
"Discussion assignments, very helpful when doing Assignments",1,sp21
Learning hands on skills!,1,sp21
"I enjoy the lectures; they're very straightforward and easy to understand, and I'm learning new things every time!",1,sp21
"The step-by-step Jupyter notebook assignments (i.e., discussion lab + assignments). The Jupyter notebooks are extremely helpful for teaching me how to code in a step-by-step, *explained* process. I really like this format compared to previous coding classes.",1,sp21
"So far, I've enjoyed learning the programming from this class",1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the group work aspect of COGS108. I love working with my group over an extended period of time to work towards a goal that we all share. Moreover, collaboration on a scale this big is sometime that's new to me, as this is the first class that I've worked on a project with group members.",1,sp21
Groupwork! Especially in pandemic with no one to talk to. And TA's technical hours are super helpful!!!,1,sp21
I liked how the class is set up so you do not fall behind especially with the project,1,sp21
"The first things that come to mind are the structure of the lectures and the assignments. For the lectures, I enjoy that we have corresponding Jupyter notebooks that we can follow along with. Also, the regular clicker questions keep us engaged in the lecture and encourage us to think about the concepts we cover.

I like that all assignments and labs are guided: we aren't just told to do something. We are given some level of hints and direction, and we have asserts to check our code. I think this is very important since many of us are new to this area. This approach ensures that we still must apply what we have learned (and also gives us practice using API references), while minimizing frustration and the likelihood of becoming stuck and unable to complete the assignments.",1,sp21
"I really enjoyed the neat little tricks that this class teaches using the different python libraries. It's refreshing to have a class where students are taught how to use libraries to their advantage (like in the labs) and I think it's really applicable to the future, even if you don't major in cs or data science.",1,sp21
The visualization aspect,1,sp21
I enjoy the hands-on experience we are getting in regards to the general direction a data science project should go.,1,sp21
Jupyter assignments have been informative,1,sp21
The overarching review of the process of data science is very clarifying.,1,sp21
"I think the instructions are much clearer than most other coding classes I've taken here and at UC Merced, not saying those were bad - but I really appreciate the organization of the class and the ease of access to resources for help.",1,sp21
Coding,1,sp21
I got used to Python and Pandas.,1,sp21
Revisit Pandas,1,sp21
Revisit Pandas,1,sp21
I enjoyed writing assignments as I think they are good practices.,1,sp21
"How to use python to coding and analyze data,",1,sp21
technical discussion really helps to explain coding parts,1,sp21
I enjoy working on the project a lot. I found a wonderful group whose members I wouldnŐt have known otherwise if not for the class!,1,sp21
"I like the interactive Lectures, working with the Juypter Notebook together is a great way to learn",1,sp21
"Working on the research project, the topic is super interesting and its good practice using Pandas",1,sp21
The lectures and working through python,1,sp21
I love the way professor ellis answers all of our questions genuinely without making people feel like they were silly and the examples used to demonstrate the concepts we learn. Both of these have made learning coding and data science much less intimidating and more fun to learn!,1,sp21
I have enjoyed lecture and my groupmates the most so far. Prof Ellis does a really good job at keeping information interesting and engaging and she makes it easy to ask questions. Most of my groupmates are easygoing and fun to talk to so it is fun to meet with them.,1,sp21
The discussion assignments,1,sp21
"Learning how to apply principles of data science (wrangling > cleaning > testing) to data gathered in the ""real world"" rather than just crafted sets handed to us.",1,sp21

"I enjoy the lecture format, I think the organization and pacing is perfect. The data we analyze is interesting as well.",1,sp21
The lectures are fairly helpful and Prof Ellis is good at explaining things for people who aren't familiar with data science,1,sp21
"What i have enjoyed most about COGS 108 is the weekly quizzes that we have, it helps to stay on track with what's going on in class. I think making the final project as group project is helpful to divide work amongst people and not just for one person so it won't seem like a giant workload.",1,sp21
I've enjoyed the assignments a lot actually! I originally really struggled with coding and it's nice to see that my hard work is paying off and the mistakes I'm making are small and not understanding errors,1,sp21
"COGS 108 helps me to know more about data science since this is my first data science course in UCSD. It helps me to know more about the ethical responsibility of being a data scientist and bringing a good question in the beginning is important as well as find a best model to analysis the data. I enjoyed all the real topic around our life or the possible solution we could use data science to find answer for and make peopleŐs life better. However, I feel like it is hard to get a 100% authentic database when it comes to the personal information or opinion. But some of the severe social problem need peopleŐs opinion on it so that we can make change to it. It is hard to make adjustment when the analysis based on the data of Ňbiased realityÓ.",1,sp21
having examples in labs so we can learn through it and not have to google everything for 3 hrs,1,sp21

I am not the strongest coder but everything new that's used is thoroughly explained and given use case examples and walk throughs. I also like that how the uses and analysis of data are related back to real world examples. The technical discussion are also v helpful to me, S/O to the IAs! :-)",1,sp21
Doing my group project. I really like the people I work with and it's fun to think through the challenges we are facing.,1,sp21
"I like learning about data ethics and privacy, and its importance! I also have enjoyed the lectures since they are pretty interesting, and technical but also applicable to real life.",1,sp21
I like the talk about data science ethics,1,sp21
I like Professor Ellis's energy during lecture and how she explains the topics. She makes the class enjoyable to learn.,1,sp21
Challenging myself to learn the content and not getting frustrated with myself because I have barely any coding experience and I find it quite hard.,1,sp21
I liked learning about how we can actually use the knowledge we learned so far and putting it into a real world project. I've also liked learning about what data ethics is and what is the proper way to use datasets we find.,1,sp21
I enjoyed learning about different python packages to make visual aids and graphs.,1,sp21
I enjoy the assignments only cuz they challenge me to use my limited coding knowledge and solve problems that we have been studying in the past.,1,sp21
The lectures and the labs/assignments. I really enjoy learning and improving my ability to code. I think the lectures have been very entertaining and have been a nice way to start my morning. They cover a variety of data science topics and are enjoyable to listen to. I also am enjoying the labs and assignments because they are allowing me to apply the concepts I've learned in class.,1,sp21
"Professor And TAs are all great and happy to answer all our questions, which makes me feel safe to make mistakes. lol~",1,sp21
Everything is really structured. I like how every week we learn more that we then work on for our final project to slowly get closer to answering the research question. The discussion labs and technical discussions are really useful to understand the application of what we learn.,1,sp21
Professor's teaching style and engagement with students.,1,sp21
"I am taking a statistics class right now, so seeing some applications and common concepts in this class has been neat. It really helps me learn in both classes.",1,sp21
"So far, I've enjoyed working on the group project which has really, given us the chance to collaborate as well as, interact with other students in this class, especially when everything is virtual and I miss the classroom interaction. I also like the fact that all the submissions are well spaced out to give us a good amount of time to complete things.",1,sp21
learning more about pandas and dataframes specifically. I know theyre very useful and efficient. Ive used them for other courses before so its always nice to learn more cool things that can be done with them.,1,sp21
"Doing the assignments on datahub, I really enjoy the hands-on practice based on the course material. I feel like this format allows me to learn quickly and a wide range of new material.",1,sp21
We have weekly meeting and I've enjoined working and discussing with my team mates.,1,sp21
I think the demonstrations in class using jupyter notebook were interesting and caught my attention.,1,sp21
The discussion labs are helpful for assignments and our project.,1,sp21
I've enjoyed getting a chance to code and see statistics come to life through graphs generated in the jupyter notebook assignments. This is my only programming class this quarter so it's nice to be able to code still.,1,sp21
"I enjoy learning digestable chunks of information (in this case learning data science). I really enjoy how you structured the class and while there is a lot to take in, it's not overwhelming! I really enjoyed learning data science so far and if I had known about it sooner I might've delved more into it!",1,sp21
Love that the material doesn't go by so fast that it's hard to understand what's happening. The assignments aren't super time consuming - takes only a few hours at best. Unlike my cse classes that have assignments that take 10-20 hours a week...,1,sp21
"I learn a lot about how to use sns , pandas, matplot",1,sp21
"Lectures are extremely well taught - I'm a novice coder but it's been very easy to follow along and understand the skills that are being taught. Prof Ellis never condescends to us for not being experts - she explains things well and answers ALL questions, no matter how simple. As someone coming in from the engineering department, that attitude is much appreciated!",1,sp21
"I really like how Professor Shannon makes high-quality slides and explain everything very clearly. On top of all, the assignment has been very helpful.",1,sp21
Professor keeps lectures very entertaining!,1,sp21
I appreciate how well-structured and laid out the course is and learning some new tools like Jupyter and using pandas. Lectures are also engaging and I enjoy the bird songs in the background. I also appreciate how Prof Ellis is very receptive to student input.,1,sp21
The lectures are more entertaining than most other classes to actually attend.,1,sp21
The lectures are stimulating and are friendly to people just entering the world of data science.,1,sp21
The group project emphasis,1,sp21
The ability to get in contact with the professor and ta's,1,sp21
straughtforwardness,1,sp21
"I've enjoyed learning about the different ways we can visualize data and deciding on which visualizations are most appropriate given our data sets. I think this information will be very helpful for not only this project, but also the data science project I'm also working on for COGS 109.",1,sp21
"I really liked the lecture and how we go through each code in class. Professor Ellis managed to convey information clearly, making it very easy to understand.",1,sp21
"I have most enjoyed getting to meet new friends, who are now in my group! My favorite technical part of the class is getting to understand how to use incredibly powerful tools like pandas and seaborn.",1,sp21
Learning how to do visualizations is fun because it's cool to be able to quickly see data in many ways.,1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the labs and assignments because they are interactive in the sense that I'm writing code and am able to see visualizations of how my data is being formatted / being graphed. I've also enjoyed the lectures a lot because of the surveys through the class period. These surveys keep me engaged throughout class time, are a lot of fun and overall a great idea to do for remote learning.",1,sp21
"Discussion Lab, enjoy learning new skills",1,sp21
"Data cleaning, it was very relaxing",1,sp21
"Data cleaning, I find it super satisfying to grab data and eliminate the garbage while formatting it into such a clean, tidy format. Once it's printed out, it's satisfying to see the perfect shape and all the data values being relevant to the question of interest.",1,sp21
"The practicality of learning certain python tools instead of focusing too much on theory like in other classes. Also the organization of the course is very good, by keeping material relevant to the final project makes it easier on the students",1,sp21
Learning about how to analyze data properly,1,sp21
"Projected-based approach, super helpful technical discussion sessions",1,sp21
Challenging myself to learn the content and not getting frustrated with myself because I have barely any coding experience and I find it quite hard.,1,sp21
Lectures,1,sp21
Sections are very helpful,1,sp21
"I enjoy learning about Pandas and using it. I think it is hard for me to learn programming, like trying to understand what I can even do with pandas and use it on actual data.",1,sp21
Learning data science and statistics has been interesting and fun. The group project has been a great way to get hands-on experience with the subject.,1,sp21
Lectures,1,sp21
I enjoy the lectures and the layout and how it's very easy to follow.,1,sp21
"API and web scraping.
It is very useful to get information I want on the Internet.",1,sp21
"I love the professor. She is so fun and sweet and understanding. Literal breathe of fresh air. Though it is super early in the morning, I find her voice so soothing. The TA's are super amazing too, and I feel this class teaches a lot while also not being overwhelming.",1,sp21
"Just the overall data science on how it is used, what is used for, etc.",1,sp21
"I enjoyed being able to apply python learning into data visualizations. I have little experience in python, but I like that I am able to see practical use in coding throughout this class. I also enjoy working on a group project and being able to test our own research question/hypothesis, and also study and analyze data that we find on our own.",1,sp21
I've enjoyed learning in the discussion labs about how to analyze data at a coding level. It is sometimes simple coding but also very efficient and beneficial when analyzing data.,1,sp21
"This was my first class that worked with data this way, and with such a hands on experience with working with datasets of our choosing. It has been great learning about the different tools that pandas provides and really being able to understand and use them.",1,sp21
"The data analysis that is explained in class, because it has really helped me learn more about data science and practices within the field.",1,sp21
I've enjoined learning Python. Feel like I'm getting a good grasp of the syntax and becomign comfortable w/ the language.,1,sp21
The ability to slow down your lectures and use git for my other classes now is pretty cool.,1,sp21
The assignments because it is a fun and challenging assignment,1,sp21
Learning practical skills about data analysis,1,sp21
I think the class is structured really well around questions that are interesting and relevant to our society today. This contextualization is great because I think I take in information better when I can see (and actually take) the next step in applying the material learned in class.,1,sp21
I've really enjoyed the hands on practice we do with the content we are learning in class.,1,sp21
I like all the discussion datahubs because they help us go over material covered in class.,1,sp21
"The project is actually fun, we're trying to find some data on Bitcoin and Dogecoin which I am very interested in.",1,sp21
Working on the asssignments is very helpful and so is the professor,1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the practical aspect of using real life data to answer questions. In particular, I found the example involving analyzing sentiment from song lyrics quite interesting.",1,sp21
i have enjoyed the vibes and explanation style. very comforting.,1,sp21
Not much at the moment but I do like the teaching skills professor.,1,sp21
Discussion lab videos - lectures are clear - Assignments are not too bad - Working on the final project has been a little fun,1,sp21
I enjoy learning about Python and how to use it for my career. It helps me prepare for future work.,1,sp21
Utilizing real world tools that I might use when I enter the workforce - e.g. pandas/matplotlib/maybe seaborn,1,sp21
"I think pandas is really useful, and the discussion of ethical issues was interesting.",1,sp21
Working on the group project -- getting to actually find data and perform data science related manipulations on it has been really interesting and fun.,1,sp21
I've enjoyed meeting the people who are in my project group and having people to go to for help.,1,sp21
"I absolutely love the overall application of Data science to general problems while still dealing with the important/difficult topics in the discipline! I had a huge issue with one of my CSS classes that didn't really account for different styles of learning/levels of ability, and it was an absolutely trainwreck for me that I barely survived. This one is great because there's so many ways to understand a concept and I love seeing it briefly in code! (The last class only had the TA code).",1,sp21
I really enjoy in-class polls and example data sets in notes. Interesting data makes me pay attention a lot better and in-person polls are helpful in testing my knowledge of the notes!,1,sp21
Improving knowledge in python coding,1,sp21
The assignment. I can apply what I have learnt and solve problems.,1,sp21
Python was easier to grasp than expected.,1,sp21
Learning how to work with data,1,sp21
It challenges me and I usually like a challenge.,1,sp21
"Lectures are very clear, informative and just straight to the point. Prof. Ellis explains every concept very effectively, no time is wasted.",1,sp21
The fact that the final project is all about being as creative as possible and having the chance to get your hands dirty on the topic of your interest.,1,sp21
How beginner friendly and concise the material is.,1,sp21
"lecture and lab part, clear and understandable",1,sp21
"I've really enjoyed learning something I've never been exposed to before, data science itself. There's definitely a learning curve of some of the more complex topics in the class, but I think it's neat how we can break down and manipulate data into more digestible formats.",1,sp21
"I really enjoy applying the skills I learned to real data and datasets, i.e. working on the project. In other classes, we learn skills but apply them to a carefully designed assignment. However, in this class we have the opportunity to apply these skills to a project with real world data and that can be really messy and definitely not ideal, but learning to handle that mess is essential to working with data in the real world.",1,sp21
"The lecture topics are pretty interesting, and the fact that you answer everyone's questions makes the learning easier. I like how you're a very compassionate and understanding professor.",1,sp21
Learning about Explorative Data Analysis,1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the hands on approach that we have been taking in our assignments and discussion labs. There's nothing wrong with theory, but it's nice to be able to apply our learning into something meaningful.",1,sp21
"I love the content in the lecture, the kindness that the professor extends to us, and working on my project.",1,sp21
"I really like the discussion labs so far, because they give a hands-on approach to the functionality of libraries.",1,sp21
Data analysis using python,1,sp21
I've quite enjoyed the labs and learned a lot of python as well as a bunch of data cleaning tricks at an approachable pace.,1,sp21
Lots of things to keep up with every week.,0,sp21
Going a little bit slow for students with prior experience,0,sp21
"The weekly quizzes- sometimes, they are vague and misleading",0,sp21
project,0,sp21
Not sure,0,sp21
"Having to deal with learning the syntax and commands used in pandas, seaborn, matplot, etc. was never going to be fun. Translating ideas into code can be pretty frustrating, especially when I'm dealing with a new language I never used before.",0,sp21
I find it a bit difficult to find the information I need since there are a lot of github repos.,0,sp21
I am a little uneasy doing a somewhat unguided/open-ended project. I feel like I have to figure out what is expected and what I should do which I understand is part of the process but it is unsettling nonetheless.,0,sp21
Possibly need more guidance on the project in terms of data wrangling and extraction.,0,sp21
Too much code but this is what this course is for.,0,sp21
Some of the assignments take a bit longer than expected.,0,sp21
"If someone procrastinates, there can be a LOT to do on Fridays.",0,sp21
The weekly discussion labs are a little hard if there is no TA explaining it in the discussion session.,0,sp21
Long wait time for feedback from Project Proposal. My team is kind of halting our discussions until we hear back in case we get criticism and will need to change topic/planned data/approach,0,sp21
"The discussion labs are helpful, but it still feels like (for me at least) that there's a huge learning curve between doing discussion and the assignments. I've been having a really tough time nailing the syntax of seaborn and pandas, and whenever I ask my groupmates for help and figure out the answer, I wonder why the answer looks so obvious and I wasn't able to get it.",0,sp21
"The quizzes. They provide a lot of stress. If they were multiple attempts with nonmuted scores, i feel like i would retain most of the information regarding past lectures.",0,sp21
Can't think of anything at the moment,0,sp21
There isn't anything I dislike about COGS 108 so far.,0,sp21
I least like the discussion assignments just because it can get somewhat difficult for me.,0,sp21
The group project is a little stressful because I feel there's a lot of uncertainty at this stage.,0,sp21
"I think working in groups have gotten harder online because some people have a great ability to slack off more, so I think my least favorite part is my group dynamics.",0,sp21
The assignment seem a little redundant as there are already weekly quizzes and discussions and their varied due dates make it less easy to remember what weeks an assignment is due or not.,0,sp21
"Not being able to work on the project as much as I would like to, due mostly to other class requirements.",0,sp21
"I have liked least the weekly quizzes, but I understand why we need to have them.",0,sp21
Sometimes it is hard to get the basic codes for doing things and the examples are too complicated to replicate in practice. I also can never do the discussion assignment without going to the technical discussion session to get guidance.,0,sp21
"It's sometimes hard for me to get an intuitive understanding of certain practices in class without the theoretical discussion, for example, when doing linear regression on log transformed data, why is dividing by 100 a good idea for understanding to relationship of the data without the log transformation.",0,sp21
"I wish there are more information shared about past project, as it takes a long time for us to figure out what we wanted to do for the project.",0,sp21
"I don't like using sns, but I guess it's fine because the graph won't look too wield even if we do it wrong in sns.",0,sp21
"I have not liked how much work this class is giving out. Truthfully, I expected there to be less work with more time being devoted to finishing a good final project, but I am juggling working on assignments, discussion labs, and the final project for this class. This is all on top of the weekly quizzes. However, I do not think that the class should be giving out any less work because then the students would not be prepared enough to work on the final project properly.",0,sp21
"I think the group work aspect and agreeing on datasets we all want to use was not fun. It was kind of difficult making sure that our question was doable based on what data we were able to find (we know we weren't supposed to do this, but it did help us stay realistic with what we wanted to research)",0,sp21
"It's a bit challenging learning pandas sometimes, since documentation can be overwhelming with all the technicalities.",0,sp21
"Nothing yet, everything has been good, but I do get lost at times with the coding.",0,sp21
Nothing! everythings great,0,sp21
"The group project stuff, just because nothing is set in stone.",0,sp21
"The group project, working in groups during the pandemic has been a struggle for me, it adds to the zoom fatigue.",0,sp21
"I don't love the project idea as much as I thought I did a week ago, although that's not specifically a COGS 108 issue. Once I'm into it a little deeper I think it will help me. Lectures are a little fast possibly, feels like it is hard to really retain all of the information even with the discussion labs. That could stem from my lack of python/programming familiarity though.",0,sp21
nothing that sticks out to me,0,sp21
"Maybe the quizzes. Since I am a novice on data science, I need a long time to digest the course content, and the time limit of quiz is a bit tight to complete all the questions. I hope we can get more attempts on quizzes to correct our mistakes, and I also hope the answers will be released immediately after we complete it.",0,sp21
The Friday dues are kind of weird. My other dues are all on weekends so sometimes I may mix up the due day for this class with my other classes (like for week 5's weekly project survey).,0,sp21
Nothing,0,sp21
Nothing in particular. I'm just waiting to delve deeper into the project at this point.,0,sp21
I think what I've liked least is the discussion labs because we already have homework assignments,0,sp21
"I haven't enjoyed the quizzes (obviously), but more importantly, the smaller random errors/bugs that are occurring in Jupyter Notebook (especially for the most recent lab).",0,sp21
I think going over some of the discussion lab in class,0,sp21
"My least favorite part of the class has been dealing with the group dynamic. There is often poor communication and a feeling of ""not being on the same page."" The project is the most significant part of the class, and dealing with uncertainty makes the project even more stressful. Of course, group-related concerns aren't something specific to this class. They can occur in any class requiring group work.

"The weekly quizzes can be stressful, but I understand why they are in place. An alternative I thought of (I think we might have done this in cogs 18 but I might be misremembering) could be quizzes with a bit less questions due the next day or two after each lecture, because then the content would be more focused for each quiz.",0,sp21

The quizzes,0,sp21
Getting familiar with different plotting libraries because it is a bit confusing and hard for me.,0,sp21
I think some of the lectures aren't really attention grabbing,0,sp21
"Probably the assignments. They're not too hard, but I get stuck sometimes.",0,sp21
"while the assignments themselves are long (understandably), some of the language is confusing and takes me a while just to understand what it is that is being asked. Once I understand that, then executing isn't too hard.",0,sp21
"I have no real issues with the course. If I had to pick one thing to change it might be the the difficulty for an entire group to get together and discuss our project. Of course, this is more of a personal/group issue than an issue with the class itself.",0,sp21
The assignments are sometimes a bit tough (lack of guidance in some sections),0,sp21
"not much interaction with fellow classmates,",0,sp21
"I think that I have not enjoyed the many different assignments that we have due at the end of each week. While I like that there is consistency with the assignments, it can sometimes get overwhelming to have so many things due on Friday. I think that the assignments are fair and representative of course material, it is just a lot to remember to do every week.",0,sp21
"I really wish I had known more Python or worked with dataframes before taking this course. It's been a bit hard to follow and I do feel lost at times when it comes to using some of the code and having the class and lectures move quickly. I am worried about the final project as well, as I'm not yet sure how to apply some of the material in class to our own particular project. I am quite intimidated and worried that the lack of knowledge and comfortability in using Python will make this class and project much more difficult.",0,sp21
"So far in COGS 108, the part that I have liked the least is that all of the deadlines are bundled together on Friday, which can sometimes make it feel a bit overwhelming on Fridays, when combined with other coursework. I think it would be helpful if there were two days of the week with deadlines. For instance, if the lecture quizzes and discussion labs were due on Wednesdays, and then the assignments/project portions were due on Fridays.",0,sp21
The quizzes are kind of killer :\,0,sp21

"Some of the assignments and project work feel a little bit long. I underestimated the amount of time they took me, as well as my teammates for the project work.",0,sp21
I'm personally not a fan of the mandatory group project during this time just because I've noticed that many of my classmates (myself included) are so burnt out with everything that's been going on for the past year. It seems like people are a lot less communicative and motivated to collaborate and put in the effort to work as a team. Although I understand the value of learning to work in these types of groups.,0,sp21
I think the pace is a bit too fast. I feel like I understood what was going on for the first couple weeks and then I got a bit lost/started feeling behind. I'm also a bit confused on how to use work on Jupyter Notebooks with GitHub like how to push/pull and commit back to GitHub. I wish the TAs were able to do a quick tutorial or if there were resources provided.,0,sp21

"Sometimes referencing tutorials or lecture content have been confusing, especially when I need help performing basic tasks like pulling/pushing on github and datahub and finding the steps on how to properly use git commands for our projects. It would be helpful for some kind of tutorial or separate file that focuses only on the step-by-step process of cloning, pulling, committing, and pushing in regards to our project templates on github.",0,sp21

Doing the Discussion Labs,0,sp21
"The thing that I like least right now is the group project, just because it seems like a daunting task. However, working in a group helps and the checkpoints also help keeps us from getting too behind.",0,sp21
"I think what I like the least is the amount of people that was required for the project. I know all groups are required to have 3-5 people, so we are given a little more wiggle room so decide on how many there will be in the group. However, I think this requirement should go down to 3-4 people. Coordinating and working on the same document with 5 people has proven difficult. (I know this issue doesn't stem from the class structure necessarily since we are given wiggle room, it is just a suggestion! Other than that, no major concerns.)",0,sp21
"I think there's a lot of constant deadlines aligning with each other in this class, such as Assignments, Labs, and project update",0,sp21

A lot of the info seems to be from COGS 9,0,sp21
"I wish the initial project proposals were submitted earlier in the quarter so that we would also receive the feedback sooner, leaving more time to make changes before the next checkpoint",0,sp21
"I wish that lectures and the projects would line up more a bit because it just sometimes feels very scattered between assignments, discussions, lectures, and project checkpoints. Sometimes lectures feel completely different from the discussion/assignment/project portion of the class, at least so far.",0,sp21
Lectures don't really hold attention.,0,sp21
Nagivating through the project has been a bit rough for our team. I guess we need more help from the tutor.,0,sp21
No real problems,0,sp21
I have least liked web searching for my data set online for the final project.,0,sp21
Collaborating on projects as there are certain things discussed in project meetings that I have no knowledge on such as machine learning algorithms.,0,sp21

"I didn't like the fact that there is no single correct solution for most problems, but I guess that's the nature of data science and I'll get used to it.",0,sp21
I don't enjoy the group project aspect of the course since working remotely and over zoom is not ideal and leads to laziness on everyone's part.,0,sp21
"What I like least about the class so far is how unintuitive pandas is compared to other forms of programming I have seen. While I am familiar with a number of languages, pandas has a medium-high learning curve and requires practice. That is where the D and A assignments come in handy though.",0,sp21
"My group project. I don't feel that my group works well together, and I end up doing a lot of the work on my own. It's frustrating.",0,sp21
"I'm not the biggest fan of the class content and it's not that related to what I want to do in the future, but that can't be helped.",0,sp21
I think what I have liked the least about COGS 108 is how fast paced it is going during the lectures.I also don't really like how confusing the whole GitHub thing works when working with other people.,0,sp21
The group project. It's a really great way to utilize the skills we're learning but my group members are not meshing and it's hard to work with a group that I feel I'm not connecting with. Not a class issue though!,0,sp21
"For project, database searching is hard to find with large enough sample and relative reference when it relates to the Ňcold feetÓ science topic. It is hard to navigate the project and understand what we really need for our project especially it is my first project. My group members are data science major with a lot of experience working on the Machine learning. I feel pressure that I need more work to catch up on them. 
For quiz, some questions are tricky like it is a multiply choice with only one right answer but the select choice buttons are like there are more than one correct choice. Also, there are always one or two abstract questions per quiz and I couldnŐt get it right even though I was in lecture every time. ŇLanguage barrier Ó hurts a lot since sometimes I may donŐt understand some analogy in the lecture that I could infer to some hidden meaning. Ouch. Thanks for this extra credit. 
For assignment, I feel like that some features of the function is vague or how to use the plotting or understand the method of applying those functions need more tutorials. Thanks to TAŐs explanation helping me with the confusion. Discussion coding is not sufficient for the project assignment.",0,sp21

The assignments can be a little confusing and I also feel a bit rushed when taking the quizzes due to the 15 minute time limit.,0,sp21
"What I liked least so far is hard to tell because I enjoy how organized the course is overall. Maybe sometimes having an Assignment and Discussion assignment due on the same day is a lot, but also we do get a fair amount of time on our actual assignments.",0,sp21
"I think learning how to write the code for the result I am trying to attain is the most challenging part, since my programming background is minimal, but I would not say that I like it the least. Overall this class is very enjoyable and one of the classes I am taking that interests me the most.",0,sp21

The thing I liked the least is how sometimes there are mistakes in the assignments which cause me some confusion over whether I am doing it right or wrong. An example is asserts not being correct.,0,sp21

I least like having to work on a massive group project and feeling like I don't know much about data science techniques to contribute much and having to wing everything or google things for hours.,0,sp21
Its hard sometimes to connect what I have learned in the lectures to what I do in the assignments. At least these past two weeks trying to understand much of the stats info has been a challenge.,0,sp21
"The project and (to a different extent) the lectures. The project is really cool but group projects are simply painful in asynchronous learning. There isn't enough substance or consistency and even with a good group (I like my group) it's hard to communicate. I like the concept of the project but even if it was executed perfectly (it's executed very well) it would still be my least favorite part because of the current nature of learning. I understand the transition from solo projects - it was too much work for each individual. But in some ways I think I might have enjoyed that. I enjoyed working on exploratory data analysis on my own in COGS 18. Regarding the lecture, it feels very educationally ""qualitative"" and not very ""quantitative."" I really enjoy the lecture but I feel like I'm not actually learning anything of substance. We jump around from topic to topic very quickly, and a lot of what we learn doesn't feel super applicable because it's very surface level. I don't want to see this class made harder, but I will say that I took COGS 109 over the summer and it was a joke. Perhaps 108 should be split into a sequence like 107a/b, and the subjects made more specific. 109 could even be replaced with the statistical/machine learning portions of 108.",0,sp21
I think so far so good~,0,sp21

Sometimes I need to do a lot of self-study online in order to complete the lab/assignment. It may be better if more materials will be covered in class.,0,sp21
"Time zone difference make it hard for my group to meet. Although most of my groupmates resides in the same time zone in UTC+8, some of them live by San Diego time (taking classes at midnights and rest during the day). It's just simpler for group work to be done in physical meeting.",0,sp21
"For the jupyter notebook assignments, it can often be difficult to come up with the right code to generate a graph/isolate a statistic. I don't know where to reference for all of the different methods and functions that I could possibly use, and what they do. I think it would be helpful to have more examples/reference guides and hints on where to look to find the methods that we need, as otherwise I get really lost and Google searches aren't always able to answer the questions I have.",0,sp21
"I think the constant deadlines, or more so how much there is due? With COVID I've seen a spike in mini-size activities but its been super overwhelming as students because we are managing multiple classes with many deadlines. 
Like usually on Fridays we have 3 assignments, quiz, discussion lab, project stuff/assignment. It requires us to stay on top of our stuff which can be hard at UC since it's quarter system and we often fall behind. I also have other class stuff due Friday (often math quizzes) and it's been hard managing all these because I need to get decent grades still.",0,sp21
"The project is the hardest thing for me right now since it requires us to be accountable and work on this steadily, but with it being remote, the motivation to work on it just isn't there. Probably unavoidable, but regardless, that's what I like the least about this class right now.",0,sp21
The quiz is too detail about the lecture sometimes I get lost,0,sp21
Project instructions are a bit unclear at this point - I'm unsure exactly what is needed to turn in for each checkpoint assignment and how to ensure our group does not lose points.,0,sp21
"I think that the project proposal should be ""re-evaluated"". As my group makes some changes to the project proposal based on the feedback, the score should be more reflective of our ""updated proposal"". I think that if this is not doable due to grading purpose, I hope that for the future class, there can be two grading of project proposal. First grading would weight 50%, and second grading of the revised proposal would weight the rest 50%. This way it also encourages students to learn from the feedback and make a better proposal.",0,sp21
Lots of work :(,0,sp21

"My least favorite part of COGS 108 has been the process of learning pandas. Although I have experience programming, pandas has been slightly annoying to learn since it seems like there are many different ways to do the same simple thing. It also sometimes seems like it takes many methods to do something that seems like it should be very simple and possible with one method. However, the notes and discussion labs have definitely helped along with the pandas documentation.

The ""topics"" don't necessarily need to be specific things, but I think that giving broad ""verticals"" that students can look over beforehand (as opposed to just the previous project review) would be a little helpful, especially since agreeing on a topic that has no ""bounds"" with 4-5 members can be difficult. Again, the current setup of the class is okay, but this is just something I felt would be helpful to some students.",0,sp21
Nothing in particular,0,sp21
"It has been hard making it to lectures in the morning but that is more of a personal issue. My group has also been having a lot of trouble working on the final project because we had to change our topic severla times and each time we would start writing out the proposal trying to figure out some sort of main question and then we later realize that the data is either non accurate, missing, or not feasible in some other way.

"It doesn't have heavy work, and everything is on the track for me.",1,wi24
many hands on experience and example of actual use case and application on real world data,1,wi24
"the assignments, because they're fun & not that difficult",1,wi24
Definitely discussions and assignments. These helped me to have a deep understanding of the class materials.,1,wi24
Learning about how to use an manipulate data especially with pandas and using more logic than code to show how one thing relates to another,1,wi24
I like the pace of the content,1,wi24
"I have enjoyed the group project. I have been pleasantly surprised by how well each of us get along, especially given that the groups are randomly assigned. Moreover, I love the freedom we have in choosing our research topic.",1,wi24
The lectures have been interesting.,1,wi24
Learning how to use python in a different application than I was taught (I learned Python through CSE 8a) and it's just fascinating in general to see data generated and visualized.,1,wi24
"The consistent support, and warmth that the instructional staff has provided me. I was away for 2 weeks but I have received support tat goes above and beyond and I thank everyone for that.",1,wi24
Working on the project ideas with my team,1,wi24
very interesting new subject that is applicable to all fields,1,wi24
Learning through the demo coding in class,1,wi24
Being able to apply what we're learning in lecture in both the labs and assignments. I really enjoy lectures and think they're paced well with a good balance of material.,1,wi24
I have enjoyed the Labs the most as well as working in a group for our project.,1,wi24
Data visualization. I've never used the seaborn library and hadn't delved too much into data vis before now.,1,wi24
Coding!!,1,wi24
"Office hours with Professor Shannon, she is very comfortable to be around and helpful for those who need help",1,wi24
"I enjoy learning about examples of data science projects, because it introduces me to things I haven't thought about.",1,wi24
The assignments are quite engaging and helpful!,1,wi24
i feel like the assignments and discussion coding has been fun so far!,1,wi24
The coding because it is fun,1,wi24
I like doing the labs and assignments the most,1,wi24
Drawing pictures and visualizing data. It is very practical.,1,wi24
I enjoyed learning about python and pandas. I think this is very useful for my career in the future.,1,wi24
the project and freedom to choose our own topic,1,wi24
yeas,1,wi24
I really enjoyed learning about EDA and Pandas since they seem to be super useful.,1,wi24
I’ve really enjoyed how the lectures are structured and furthering out learning about things we got to see in our discussion labs.,1,wi24
The assignments on jupyter notebook have been pretty engaging and interesting,1,wi24
"My favorite part so far has been doing the labs and the guest lecturer. I really like how they were somewhat challenging but not overwhelming, and I got to practice with the concepts we learned in class. I also really liked being able to hear from a real data scientist.",1,wi24
Deal with different kind of datasets,1,wi24
The use of real world skills,1,wi24
"I have enjoyed the format of the class. I also enjoyed the use of the notebooks to help me learn Python, as I have always struggled with learning programming languages.",1,wi24
The labs are fun and coming up with our own project is also fun.,1,wi24
I have enjoyed the part that was discussing the data intuition in which I learned about the myth of power of ten,1,wi24
"learning more about working with pandas, numpy, seaborn, and other libraries in python.",1,wi24
I like to spend time learning new coding methods.,1,wi24
"I love how much practice we get with coding, such as in the discussion labs and in the assignments.",1,wi24
Labs!! The labs are so interesting and easy to understand. You could see the cleaning and the visualizations so nicely! The labs are also very instructive so we know what we are retrieving.,1,wi24
Data visualizations. Experimenting with the ways the data can be plot onto a graph is pretty fun and interesting.,1,wi24
I have enjoyed learning about how data can be safely and ethically used. I think this is very important because it teaches me how to responsibly use data,1,wi24
"Prof Ellis' material is delivered in a super approachable and practical manner, which is a refreshing change.",1,wi24
accessible information,1,wi24
"Lecture style is very enjoyable. I am happy to be in an intro class that finally feels like an intro class. Where new concepts are being explained in class and even surrounding topics are also elaborated on, rather than others were they throw you right in.",1,wi24
I have enjoyed doing the discussion coding assignments because it really is more focused on learning rather than being graded. I feel like I can code for fun and not for a grade,1,wi24
"The ability to work remotely, this has been a huge help given I have had to do a lot of travelling for my family this quarter.",1,wi24
the discussion projects,1,wi24
i think that the group project has had an interesting and promising start,1,wi24
I mostly have enjoyed learning more about python and being able to put it to practice in labs and assignments.,1,wi24
"I like that all the assignments are due Sunday night so it is easy to keep track of, I also like that the instructions for projects are very clear.",1,wi24
I have really enjoyed the group project so far as it has allowed my group and I to ask a analysis question that interests us.,1,wi24
I have enjoyed using datahub and the jupyterhub notebook to complete these assignments compared to other classes.,1,wi24
I enjoyed the overall lecture experience and knowledge about data science. I haven't really come across using data in the way this class is structured. I think it's interesting knowing how there is so many elements you have to considered when doing a research question.,1,wi24
"What I have enjoyed the most about COGS 108 so far has been being able to learn about data science while also being able to expand and grow my coding skills. This has been able to make me feel more confident in myself and my coding abilities, allowing me to be more prepared to take on future coding projects.",1,wi24
"Learning Pandas, I really enjoy coding and have found it fun to learn how the pandas library works.",1,wi24
I've enjoyed the collaborative aspect of this class. I'm not super good at coding but my group mates have helped me a lot by explaining things and guiding me through some problems.,1,wi24
I enjoy seeing how to be able to sort through the data. It is tough to remember but I am starting to understand it more.,1,wi24
I'm practicing solving real problems,1,wi24
"I've enjoyed the collaborative aspect of the course. I typically dislike courses that implement group projects as the final exam/largest portion of the grade, however, I find that it's helped me feel less isolated in the course and more anchored in to the content (facilitating the course content in a practical, independent way)",1,wi24
I enjoy coding,1,wi24
Learning all the great technique in Data Science; Collaborate with team member to build our project,1,wi24
Course content has been quite engaging! Also lectures are great. I feel like there's a lot of time in between clicker questions for us to really think. I'm enjoying the content!,1,wi24
I enjoyed the discussion assignments so far because they’re not too difficult to complete as long as you keep up with course content,1,wi24
The thing I have enjoyed most about COGS 108 so far is definitely the Discussion assignments. I feel like the discussion labs lets us get a good understanding of what we learned in lecture.,1,wi24
Learning how Python works (I had no idea how to code in Python before this),1,wi24
Understanding how to create data visualizations and which graphs work better than others for specific tasks.,1,wi24
"I love the practice we get from discussions and assignments on data science libraries! It feels like in computer science courses a lot of that work is abstracted away, so I appreciate the depth of practice.",1,wi24
"I really like the labs honestly. I feel like I learn a lot in the assignment. If I'm confused I look up the operator I have to use and seeing it all workout with no penalty is super helpful and really rewarding. I'm also in another python class right now that doesn't;t use pandas and I've come to realize how much I really like pandas. This is my second pandas class (I took DSC 10) and I'm in CSE 8A right now, and I prefer pandas over typical python.",1,wi24
I have enjoyed programming in python. Both my other major classes require me to code in C. It is definitely refreshing to work on COGS 108. The assignments and discussions have been really interesting.,1,wi24
the lecture,1,wi24
Lectures - They are fun!,1,wi24
I really enjoy the fact that I can work through jupyter hub and the way the assignments walk me through every step and explains what each part of the code does.,1,wi24
Learning about how to manipulate data.,1,wi24
I enjoy the real-world applications to the data analysis,1,wi24
I have really enjoyed going to lecture and learning about data science since Professor Ellis is a great lecturer. I also enjoy how the discussion help me learn to apply pandas and seaborn to dataset.,1,wi24
Doing the lab and assignment really helps me improve my practical skills.,1,wi24
"I like how I can connect concepts I've learned in the past in classes like COGS 9 to hard skills I've developed, this is most visible in the discussions and labs, where we can practice the concepts we learned through code.",1,wi24
I've enjoyed how complicated concepts are explained in a clear and simple way.,1,wi24
I enjoy learning about data science! It seems really interesting.,1,wi24
I love our in class experimentations on different types of graphs that describe a dataset.,1,wi24
I enjoy working on the group project the most since it feels like I'm putting the skills I have learned so far to test.,1,wi24
"How well structured the class has been, everything makes sense and new concepts come at comfortable pace.",1,wi24
Understanding how to use plots and charts to make cohesive analysis of large data.,1,wi24
The content of lectures is fun and easy to understand most of the time,1,wi24
I really enjoy the lectures and how the prof explains everything in such detail,1,wi24
The set up of Discussion Lab and Assignments. It's very clear to go through each concept.,1,wi24
The team work,1,wi24
The learning about pandas,1,wi24
Working in groups,1,wi24
"We have to work in a group. personally speaking, I dont like group projects",0,wi24
"I don't really like when labs, lecture, and assignments are released and students can't run the code without errors popping up. For many who are not familiar with Python, it is hard to figure out these error messages. A lot of the lab code especially always has errors.",0,wi24
weekly lecture quizzes,0,wi24
"Assignment, because its also time consuming.",0,wi24
Group members not responding,0,wi24
"The assignments are very hard for me. I am new to git, github, & jupytr notebooks so all the jargon, syntax, folders, etc.. is overwhelming and intimidating.",0,wi24
Some weeks having both discussion and an assignment due,0,wi24
I sometimes have difficulty with the D & A Assignements,0,wi24
The weekly quizzes are rather time consuming and don't really reflect the course material learnt that well sometimes,0,wi24
I do not like the weekly quizzes because they are timed.,0,wi24
The quizzes are a bit too unrelated imo,0,wi24
I don’t like being assigned to a group because I cannot work on group projects with my friends.,0,wi24
Too much introduction to python,0,wi24
"I haven’t really not liked anything, although it was hard to do the previous project review and understand someone else’s code at times (maybe because we haven’t learned all the different techniques yet)",0,wi24
"I don't really like Python, because I feel like the only thing I'm doing for the homework is finding the right function.",0,wi24
COGS 108 has been fun! The only thing I don't like is how early the class is :( (and I have a conflict with the 2pm section so I cant go to that one),0,wi24
"Need to walk at least 15 minute from my apartment to the classroom, especially during the raining day, I know it isn't actually related to the class, but other than that, everything is fine.",0,wi24
I tam not really enjoying pandas. I know the class is all in pandas but there's a lot of syntax behind it and I'm having a hard time understanding the parameters and the order to do things.,0,wi24
"Since this is the first time I'm learning about data science, I wouldn't know I don't like this but I struggling with learning how to use pandas and wrangling since there are a lot of different functions and codes, and it gets pretty confusing.",0,wi24
"The lack of direction with the projects. This might be my own doing, however, I am slightly confused about this whole process.",0,wi24
"So far, I have least liked the Assignments, because of the hidden tests. I feel I am doing the assignment right and understanding the code, but then when I receive my grade, it does not match up with what I thought. I understand the hidden tests raise the stakes of the assignments and are there for a reason, but I feel as though I learn best from the discussion labs, which do not have any hidden tests and you have a clear understanding of whether or not you are coding properly.",0,wi24
"I've disliked the frequency of assignments (I also feel like the actual Assignments are quite lengthy in nature), and this can be tough to manage with midterm schedules of other classes. I wish we had more ""late/slip"" days.",0,wi24
The group I have for the project. Not all members communicate effectively and contribute the same amount so its a bit concerning.,0,wi24
My team hasn’t been the easiest to work with so far. I also wish there were more office hours.,0,wi24
"It would've been nice to pick our own groups, since this might make project planning easier and give us a chance to find a group with similar interests and skills. But, I have no complaints about my group.",0,wi24
The programming assignment and discussion assignments have coding portion that we do not go over in class. It would be nice to have more review and time to spend on learning the syntax of pandas and seaborn.,0,wi24
"The emphasis in lecture seems somewhat disproportionate: while the class does acknowledge a certain level of familiarity in Python it still seems strange we quickly rush over code for various table manipulating tools but spend half a class on the differences between histograms, bar plots and other graphs.",0,wi24
"As a beginner to programming and coding, I thought that sometimes it’s quite confusing what each syntax means and sometimes I don’t understand why I have errors when running codes.",0,wi24
The thing I liked least about this course so far is that we have to submit work on datahub since I don't think the UI is very intuitive and can be confusing at times.,0,wi24
What I've least liked about COGS 108 is the entire course.,0,wi24
"My least favorite thing was when I was doing D3, I wasn't aware I should have done A2 first and I struggled a lot more than I should have.",0,wi24
"Data visualization week was very repetitive of DSC 106, but it definitely is necessary to understand how to make visualizations and what makes them ""good"" or ""bad"".",0,wi24
I've liked the 9am class time the least because I don't like getting up early.,0,wi24
Sometimes I do not like the lack of instruction on the labs because I'm not sure if I am doing it right (but I feel like that's the point).,0,wi24
"everything good, but when i use data hub, sometimes it's really slow.",0,wi24
i think the pace for the project is a little fast,0,wi24
"plots, since they are not fixed (meaning you can have multiple answers) and I'm not familiar with it.",0,wi24
Assignments,0,wi24
The Assignment or Lab instruction can be a little bit open ended which make doing the assignment a little bit confusing of what the expectation would be.,0,wi24
What I like least so far about Cogs 108 are the labs. I think the labs have been much more difficult compare to the assignments.,0,wi24
I'm aware that this isn't like an intro data science class but I did not expect to jump right into learning about it and only briefly going over python basics (I took COGS 18 last year so it wasn't exactly fresh in my mind).,0,wi24
i don't know what kind of question to ask for final project and everything cramped in midterm season,0,wi24
"The assigned group projects and lab/assignment directions. I have hesitations around group projects and even more-so when I do not know the other group. Mine has been a bit difficult, but the Professor has been helping me as the quarter continues, so I think it will get better. The lab directions and the assignment directions are often unclear. I feel like a lot of the time I am guessing as to what the directions want from me. I feel like the wording could be a bit more clear. If I have to look at multiple sections of the problem to figure out what they might want, then I think there is room for improvement.",0,wi24
So far something that I least liked is the communication within the group.,0,wi24
the quizzes should have another attempt,0,wi24
I disliked the complicated commands that is used on making bar graphs/sea plots,0,wi24
I have no complaints for this class.,0,wi24
the assignment and discussion is more time consuming than I expected. I expected 2 hours for A2 but actually I spent 5 hours since i was very new to everything. For D3 I spent about 4 hours to double check the answer and make sure I understand the prompt correctly. Some of the D3 instruction is not clear enough.,0,wi24
Mostly the lack of passion and communication for Cogs 108 Project which is expected given the randomized assignment of members. It is very difficult to light a fire under people who see this class as a check in the box. I also feel separated from potentially meeting others who are genuinely excited in doing something interesting. This gives me further insight of why talent management and team cohesion are so important.,0,wi24
I think the quizzes are a pain,0,wi24
Difficulty in planning with groups,0,wi24
"The project isn't explained very well at the beginning of the quarter. I feel like we have a rough idea of what to do but for people that are not familiar with the subject I think it would be nice in the future to have like half a class for instance discussing what the project will look like, a good example and the feedback the professor gives, and time for the students to ask the professor questions about the topic.",0,wi24
"The due date being Sunday has been very stressful for me personally. I’m part of a competitive dance team on campus, and have had competitions on weekends, making the Sunday night due date for everything difficult to make. It has definitely impacted my performance on the assignments, as I missed small things that were caught by hidden tests later. In the future, I think Monday night, would be a better option. That way we have the weekend to work and, in the worst case scenario, get last minute help on Monday before submitting.",0,wi24
discussions are harder than assignments,0,wi24
the assignment instructions sometimes seem to be confusing,0,wi24
"Learning to code is difficult right now. I took COGS 18 and have other programming experiences using python. However, I have very little experience with stats and found it difficult to understand the documentation for Seaborn. More clarification on how the syntax works would be helpful.",0,wi24
It’s a bit confusing seeing which assignments I have done and submitted. In general keeping track of assignments,0,wi24
"Sometimes it may not be completely helpful when I am trying to look back while trying to complete the discussion labs and assignments. That is usually ok because then I would try to search it up on Google, but it can be somewhat frustrating to do so.",0,wi24
"Not being able to choose teams, but its not that big a deal",0,wi24
"I did not like how D3 was much more difficult compared to A2, as I would have expected the main assignment (A2) to be harder than the lab assignment (D3). However, I usually complete D# before A#, and I wish that the D#'s could be formatted in a more guided walkthrough.",0,wi24
"I would like the labs for the discussion assignments to give more specific instructions on what functions we should be using to complete the question. Sometimes, it asks us to do something that we have never done before without giving us the library function that we need to use to answer the question.",0,wi24
"I've least enjoyed the quizzes, they also feel tedious, but they don't take long so it's not a huge issue.",0,wi24
"Accessibility to get help. Probably towards getting help on assignments or discussion work. All I know of are my lab hours, but usually I take up the entire time completing the discussion assignment. Also it was a bit difficult to coordinate good timings with my team, which is out of control of the course and staff of course, but that was a small issue.",0,wi24
"Struggled with the assignment. Because I have a really poor coding background, I needed to look up a lot of things online. However, this is my problem and I understand the course design, so this has nothing to do with the course.",0,wi24
"I guess the random group assignment. Although I know that it is often the case in real life that people from different background need to work together, it takes a lot more time to communicate between each other since we have different expectations and experience.",0,wi24
"Uncertainty about project, feeling stuck.",0,wi24
Everything is good so far.,0,wi24
"Although there is nothing severe, there are certain parts of instructions that are often unclear.",0,wi24
Sometimes feel like there are too many assignments to keep track of.,0,wi24
"I appreciate that we've gone over the basic concepts however I feel like so far what we've learned in class isn't aligning to the bigger scope of what we have to complete for our project. For example, our project proposal is due however I dont know how to go about deciding on a research question.",0,wi24
Don’t have too much communication with my group,0,wi24
Datahub sometimes freezes or has trouble running.,0,wi24
Nothing so far,0,wi24
"I have disliked when my code doesn't run and I am stumped. But, it ends up ok!",0,wi24
Weekly discussion is not that helpful for me since it just went over the discussion assignments.,0,wi24
"Some of the questions on the datahub assignments are a bit confusing and unclear. Especially for the ones that require visualizations. If some of the questions could be a little more clear, it would be highly appreciated.",0,wi24
I found the last lab difficult and didn't enjoy doing it because it took a long time trying to figure out what worked and what package methods to use.,0,wi24
I feel like I like everything so far. Maybe the tests and hidden tests are hard to understand.,0,wi24
Some of the discussion lab content can be much harder than the examples given in class. I would like to see more examples in general.,0,wi24
So far I think the pase of the class overall is too slow.,0,wi24
"The one Sunday that had a discussion, assignment, project review, and week quiz. It felt a little overwhelming.",0,wi24
I like drawing plot the least.,0,wi24
I have disliked not knowing the solutions to assignments and discussions after they have been graded. I believe I have gotten the right output for every assignment but I don't think my code was the optimal way to produce such result. I am new to pandas and seaborn and would like to know what the most efficient way to get the desired output.,0,wi24
Sometimes the assignments/discussion assignments take a long time and there are kind of limited office hours.,0,wi24
my friends stopped showing up to lecture :(.,0,wi24
One thing I liked the least about is the vague grading system. Sometimes I don't understand what the lab questions are asking for and what kinds of answers are accepted.,0,wi24
"I feel that I have to do a lot of outside research to figure out how to do the assignments. I understand that any tech job requires a constant drive to learn and problem-solve, but it can be a bit frustrating when you're learning something fundamental for the first time.",0,wi24
i feel like the class goes by really slowly but i think that's more on me,0,wi24
NO detail about homework,0,wi24
coming to session in R,0,wi24
"After reviewing past final projects, I felt a little bit stressed about the length and difficulty of the project (but overall felt excited).",0,wi24
"communicating with my group has been a bit difficult, but I think it will be better from now on.",0,wi24
Nothing so far!,0,wi24
I least liked the fact that the iclicker app required a subscription after the trial,0,wi24
"I generally don't have any complaints about the class; my experience has been very positive overall. However, there are a couple of minor inconveniences I've encountered. Accessing the PDFs on DataHub still doesn't work for me (I get a blank screen) and also, the process for submitting assignments feels a bit uncertain. The lack of confirmation emails or a clear indication of which file has been submitted can sometimes be worrying. I understand that these issues may be beyond the professor's direct control and more related to the platform's limitations, but if there are any improvements that could be implemented, it would certainly help with this issue. Generally, I do enjoy how everything is centralized and accessible from Datahub and how we don't need many different platforms to manage files and submit our assignments.",0,wi24
"I hope the labs could also help us on more than just lab, as assignments and projects are more challenging than labs.",0,wi24
"As for now, I enjoyed everything in COGS 108.",0,wi24
"Nothing, everything is great",0,wi24
Using datahub,0,wi24
"If I had to choose something that I like the least about COGS 108, I think it's been a bit difficult engaging with my project group. One of our group members has not interacted in our group chat or meetings at all, and I'm worried that this will impact our overall grade on the project.",0,wi24
group projects stress me out,0,wi24
Assignments can feel overwhelming during this time of the quarter,0,wi24
"I think the quizzes just because we have to wait till friday to do them since I like to finish the other assignments due Sunday earlier if I can. However, it does make sense since we need to have the week lectures done before it and at least they are not too long.",0,wi24
assigned teammates,0,wi24
My least favorite thing so far has been trying to figure out a topic with my group for our project proposal. I think that we had a variety of different interests so it was more of a challenge to find something that everyone was passionate and knowledgeable about.,0,wi24
"D3. I was overthinking about how to do the different visualizations, so that took quite a while. I was getting frustrated but then was eventually able to figure out a simpler way to make them.",0,wi24
"I have a hard time with coding, so figuring out data wrangling has been tough",0,wi24
"D3 - I had a really hard time with some of the problems, especially the one involving displaying a table based on the male/ female cheating proportions. It felt like there was supposed to be an easy way to do it but I ended up having to do it manually from the value counts. The value counts object type also confuses me, it seems to be kind of accesible in a similar way to a df but some things that are supposed to work on DFs dont work on them. I'm also super confused by the groupby and aggregate functions",0,wi24
"I was not too fond of the iClicker EC, as it requires students to purchase either the physical device or the subscription of iClicker to participate. I understand that it is an extra credit therefore participation is optional, but I believe the option to participate should be open to all without financial burden. iClickers can easily be replaced with other methods such as Google Form or non-subscription based participation tracker. In addition, some exercises on assignments and Discussion Labs require knowledge beyond what we are taught in class, especially in knowing specific methods to organize dataset. Sometimes it requires a learning beyond simple Lab sections or internet search where I had to spend multiple hours on one part of the question. I wish the difficulties of these questions be modulated, so that it is challenging enough but also solvable within an hour or two.",0,wi24
I wish there was more time given for explaining the code and how it can be used to implement different features for the graph.,0,wi24
"The group project aspect of it. I am the kind of person that doesn't like group projects in general, which this class hopefully will help me overcome. It has also been difficult coordinating with the group so far, which makes me nervous for the future of this project. I understand that this is a necessary part of professional development but it is the least pleasant part of this course for me.",0,wi24
"So far, there has not been anything I have disliked about COGS 108 so far. Even though coding is not my main interest or the focus of my major, I have greatly enjoyed learning and practicing coding in general, and I have yet to find something about the course or the topics being taught that I dislike.",0,wi24
"I don't enjoy the usage of iClicker for the extra credit participation. Yes, I understand it is completely optional, but I just think iClickers (device or the app) put up an economic barrier to entry in the sense that you'll have to pay anywhere from $15 to $45 to access that option. I know many others have had iClickers before this class, but this is my first class at UCSD that has used them, so I myself had to pay. I DO enjoy the participatory aspect of them -- the in-class little quiz questions are excellent ways to test my understanding -- but I feel a different method can be explored. (For example, COGS 101A last quarter tracked participation with Google Forms while still employing the mid-lecture question method.)",0,wi24
I can't really think of anything.,0,wi24
I'm not the biggest fan of random groups as we all have very different ideas for things.,0,wi24
"I don't like making graphs. Especially, I think making a good graph is challenging.",0,wi24
"some library functions are very specific, documentation is sparse",0,wi24
"I think having numerous assignments all due on the same day can be overwhelming sometimes, though I do like having the confidence that nothing will be due until that day each week.",0,wi24
"Coding D: just because I'm not a ""pro"" at it yet so sometimes it gets a bit frustrating when I'm trying to solve something but I keep getting an error",0,wi24
"Maybe some of the code on the discussion questions was confusing, but otherwise I have nothing to say.",0,wi24
"Maybe this is just how upper division classes are (I'm a first year so I have only taken one besides this) but I didn't see much of a 'tutorial' for things like git, seaborn or matplotlib. Just meant I had to look up the documentation and learn for myself which isn't necessarily bad, just a little more time-consuming.",0,wi24
Working with people who simply want to get work done and get things over with.,0,wi24
"Sometimes I get frustrated with the assignments, I usually get really stressed out from Thursday - Sunday night if my assignments are not completed, but I realize that learning is not always smooth and that I am simply on a different learning path than everyone around me!",0,wi24
Having to do a project with people I don't care about is really annoying. It would be better if they were more competent/proactive.,0,wi24
I don't like how the assignments are not super specific. I wish the instructions were better,0,wi24
I have liked reading the pandas documentation the least. This is because I tend to learn better with examples in front of me rather than trying to figure them out by reading the documentation.,0,wi24
"What I've liked least about the course is the final project. I think that being able to see the entire rubric for a very large project became very overwhelming, and being able to only see one step at a time would help me to slow down and pinpoint exactly what is expected of me.",0,wi24
"Since there is usually info from all 3 lectures during the week that is needed for labs and assignments, it is a bit difficult to work on those HWs ahead of time, since I often have to wait until Friday to understand certain things or I can't always attend lab early enough in the week to be able to do the labs. As in, it ends up often that they can only fully be done on the weekend. I know one solution (and maybe an aim of the class) is to break it up and do just a portion at a time to incorporate what was learned each day in lecture, but that is not always feasible since it's easier to do it all over a shorter time span of a couple days, but still harder to complete ahead of time (especially when trying to not do things last minute!)",0,wi24
I disliked that I don't know where to look for resources on the python libraries that we use. There are SO MANY on google and it's hard to find what actually answers a question I have or applies to what we are specifically doing in a lab or assignment. If the course staff could compile a list of sites (maybe there's already a reading list that I missed?) and announce it (or remind if there already is an existing one for this course) it'd be deeply appreciated.,0,wi24
"Sometimes I feel like the jump from what we do in lecture to what we have to figure out in the Demo assignments is a little fast. I feel like I pay attention during lectures and follow along in the notes, but I often spend quite a while on the assignments trying to figure it out.",0,wi24
The group project. I know it's good for us，but everyone is so busy that it's hard to schedule time for discussion,0,wi24
The wording for labs and assignments. Especially with D3 it was confusing what exactly some of the questions wanted me to do.,0,wi24
I don’t really like making the graphs haha,0,wi24
I dislike the discussion labs because they are tedious and difficult.,0,wi24
"I'm struggling to come up with answer to this because I can't think of anything to complain about for this class, so this question. Have had some issues with datahub going down around 8pm one time when I tried submitting a lab, but I suppose its the servers getting stressed from every other student trying to submit their hw the night its due",0,wi24
My least favorite part about COGS 108 is the coding work because it is difficult.,0,wi24
"I've not liked how slow it is so far, but that's because I have a lot of experience with pandas and data science.",0,wi24
I think i find the pacing a little slow up till now but am noticing an increase in pace from this week onwards.,0,wi24
The large amount of busy work because I am getting overwhelmed by other classes.,0,wi24
I liked the assignments least because its sometimes challenging for me to do and I’ll have to spend some time on it.,0,wi24
"As someone who has a lot of group project assignments this quarter, in general, I would’ve not preferred to have an another one on top of them. Nonetheless, it’s interesting to apply the course concepts in a setting like this one.",0,wi24
Not much to complain about. I wish there was more explanation for the graphs and how to customize the graphs,0,wi24
I think D3 was kind of hard and confusing based on what was taught in class. I felt like I still had to look things up a lot on my own outside of the notes. I also would prefer to learn everything needed for the assignments and labs by monday so that we can start on both earlier just in case it takes longer.,0,wi24
There is nothing that I dislike. I think it is a very structured course.,0,wi24
"Least favorite part is the inability to take this class on zoom. I wish that was an option because it makes it a lot easier to access, especially during the times of extreme weather.",0,wi24
What I liked the least about COGS 108 is that collaborating with our teams for the project is a bit tough as some people disappear for a long time and did not really help much for the previous assignment.,0,wi24
"One thing that I like least is the inability to choose groups. I think CSE110 was fair with how groups were chosen, they allowed us to choose a partner and then paired 3 random pairs together to form a group.",0,wi24
The group project is really hard to organize and have everyone participate. My group always has at least one or two people missing from our meetings so it's hard to anticipate how much we can get done before the due date.,0,wi24
Not sure,0,wi24
Nothing really.,0,wi24
"I don't really like how our labs are not really helpful for finishing the discussion labs. I am not going to the session that I signed up for, but I don't find the session I'm going to helpful. I hope we can have more constructive help in the labs for finishing the discussion labs.",0,wi24
not a lot of practice coding during the lecture making the assignments feel a little harder,0,wi24
There are many EC opportunities which is awesome.,0,wi24
"Code not working, errors, not knowing what is causing those errors.",0,wi24
"Nothing specific, I think the class is greatly designed.",0,wi24
"The labs have been a little lengthy and frustrating... from my experience with COGS 18, I expected the labs to be more straightforward in order to help with the assignments, but it seems to be the opposite in this course.",0,wi24
Nothing so far.,0,wi24
"I can't participate in lectures without an iClicker, and that costs money to purchase. I don't have other classes that need an iClicker, so I'm opting out of that form of extra credit.",0,wi24
"I don't really like how are the assignments are on data hub, not gradescope etc, but at the same time it is good to get familiar with this environment as I am using it in other classes as well",0,wi24
Very little instruction most of the lectures do a poor job of explaining packages being used,0,wi24
"My least favorite part so far has been the initial phase of getting in contact with the group, though that doesn't have to do with the class or group specifically, so much as just how the process generally goes, and the difficulty of scheduling time where everyone is available.",0,wi24
"I think some discussion assignments like the recent one were too confusing in the wording that it was hard to figure out. In particular, creating graphs is very confusing and I feel like I need to learn more about it.",0,wi24
Sometimes I was facing weird issues when submit my lab.,0,wi24
Lack with integration of LLM's as I feel like this is vital to the current practice of data science. (I could be wrong),0,wi24
I would like if participation was worth more,0,wi24
I think the Python basics took too much time because I think most of people enrolled in this course should have programming experience.,0,wi24
The least enjoyable part was recounting on the python basics,0,wi24
"I have not disliked anything about the course so far, just hoping my group project gets through smooth sailing in starting the quarter-long assignment!",0,wi24
I think there are too much work for me to do every week. There are different assignment and quiz for students. It is hard to memorize when to submit which assignment.,0,wi24
"I think randomized grouping is not very efficient, though I understand that is what it like in working environment. But we can only have fraction of time meeting each week so the whole project is going really slow.",0,wi24
I think the instructions for the assignments can sometimes be a little vague so it takes longer to understand exactly what the question is asking for.,0,wi24
"The final project is intimidating, especially with random group members that are sometimes unresponsive or do not seem like they really want to try.",0,wi24
"honestly, the data visualizations because I'm still learning Python so it's been more time-consuming than I predicted but it's not so bad. The group project is also a bit confusing but we're just getting started so perhaps I'll understand more with time.",0,wi24
Having some connection errors with datahub. Not sure how it can be fixed though.,0,wi24
"Navigating to the material. I usually use computer for jupyter notebook and iPad for pdf lecture. If you can upload the pdf of lecture on canvas, that is much more accessible for me!",0,wi24
I have disliked the group project in this class so far as I believe it may take a long time to accomplish the whole project but am still ready to work with my group and complete it as we have a great start already.,0,wi24
"The thing that I have liked least about COGS 108 is that I had to pay for an iclicker app subscription because I didn't have and want to use the physical kind. I understand that it's not really the instructors' fault, but of course I don't like using up money.

Other than that, everything is fairly smooth sailing.",0,wi24
"At times, the material covered in COGS108 and COGS189 seems to overlap, particularly during the initial three weeks. However, as the courses progress, it becomes apparent that COGS108 focuses more on data programming.",0,wi24
I don’t think I learned a lot of technical things.,0,wi24
"Nothing in particular, maybe that lectures aren’t spent working on harder material that the assignments showcase, concepts in lect are quite simple but actually applying them is hard",0,wi24
"Sometimes the instructions on the assignment and labs are unclear. Sometimes I worry that I have points knocked off even though all my assert tests pass. I also have never used github before. There was a lecture on it to work through it, but that doesn't guide me through it very well. I have also done the github tutorial, but it still doesn't make sense to me.",0,wi24
"I hate GitHub. I have no clue how to use it. We have to submit our proposal on GItHub and I'm scared I'm going to mess up. My members also don't know how to so like, it is up to me apparently, which is no shade to them, just like :(.",0,wi24
The prompts in the discussions and assignments are open ended in regards to the approach we can use which is fine but sometimes what is looked for in the end result is not entirely clear.,0,wi24
I kind of do not like how the quiz and lab are given out on Friday and due Sunday. I personally would prefer finishing all my assignments during the week days and have some personal time on the weekends...,0,wi24
"The fact that we didn't get to choose our own groups, but I understand that choice. Still, it would have been way more fun to work with people I am close with and we could probably finish one of the greatest projects of all time.",0,wi24
group project.,0,wi24
PA's,0,wi24
"While it is a relief that we don't have any exams for this class, I am a bit lost about how to study for this course.",0,wi24
"I wish we could get more insight into the code, some f the discussion labs were more open ended and I had to search up a lot of the stuff.",0,wi24
"By the same token, I have least liked the coding aspect but not for the application of it, more like the concept of coding itself. However, it's just a learning curve and a personal challenge it's not that serious of a dislike. I do appreciate that I was fairly warned at the start of the quarter!",0,wi24
it's been pretty good so far,0,wi24
"I think the pace of this class is ok, but it is kind of daunting seeing previous projects and how time consuming they may be. I am worried about time management regarding this class' big project and my other classes.",0,wi24
the labs - these are a lot more work than I anticipated and they sometimes cover material that we did not go over in class,0,wi24
I have liked the least how the labs/assignments descriptions and questions are confusing which makes them hard to understand what it is asking for.,0,wi24
"I'm a bit unsure how we should be pacing our projects and how often we should be meeting. I suppose I'm used to a team project being the main focus of the class, and not so much as a side thing that students have to do entirely themselves. I think having a requirement to go to at least one discussion time would help my mindset about this class, but I realize that it gives students a lot of flexibility with the structure right now.",0,wi24
The fact that we cannot choose our groups for the final project. I feel like the groups would mesh better and be able to communicate better if we could choose them ourselves or at least choose some of the group members,0,wi24
The group project has been a bit rough.,0,wi24
"I think it has been a little hard to follow the slides, but it is still manageable.",0,wi24
"Sometimes, labs can be more challenging than assignments and able to see the test cases would be really helpful.",0,wi24
"Labs can be a little confusing since there is less guidance; also think it has been a little hard connecting lecture content to the labs at times.
It also would have been nice to pick our group members for the project, but I understand you are studying how self-picked versus assigned groups work.",0,wi24
"Probably the wrangling data part. The syntax are complex and hard to remember. Errors occur here and there, and they appear so easily with each additional line of codes... I always have a headache trying to deal with unorganized data.",0,wi24
I would like this class to be a little bit faster and include more topic.,0,wi24
I don't have anything particular in mind but maybe the constant deadlines/due dates is hard to track,0,wi24
"Felt unprepared for lab 3 despite going to lecture,",0,wi24
Communicating with my group because its hard to get 5 people on the same page.,0,wi24
"I have liked the group project the least so far, as it has been challenging to communicate and find time to work together.",0,wi24
"I don't really enjoy the group project. I feel as though if we were able to pick groups, it would be much better on coordinating schedules, but because of the randomization it becomes really hard to meet consistently.",0,wi24
Haven't really touched on anything yet since most of the course has been coding up to now. But now we are moving into our projects so I know there is going to be a lot less coding going on and more thinking involved with creating a project. There is going to need to be analysis and explaining of findings which is not particularly fun.,0,wi24
"Sometimes the class feels slow, because of my previous experience in Data Science, but I still enjoy it.",0,wi24
I am not sure. I think I would like more TAs/IAs to hold remote office hours or sections because it feels easy to drop in that way while working on assignments.,0,wi24
I am pretty bad at coding and it's really unfamiliar to me so sometimes it's really hard for me to see where I'm making a mistake in the homework.,0,wi24
I least like the assignments since I think that there is a lot work for the class,0,wi24
Maybe some more resources on debugging could be helpful.,0,wi24
"Communicating with my group has been difficult at times, but I understand communication is always difficult in group projects and I need to learn how to best communicate with group mates regardless of if we agree or not.",0,wi24
I wish to have more application of the things I have learned.,0,wi24
The group work assignments are a little long.,0,wi24
Some of the discussion problems don't really specify which dataset is being used,0,wi24
"Some of the weekly labs have been kind of difficult. I like the quizzes, but there are so many things to do by Sunday it gets hard to keep track of them all.",0,wi24
It's been more difficult to do the assignments and quizzes because the material doesn't fully tell us how to set up some things.,0,wi24
Personally the assignments and discussions have been boring for me since I have learned all of that information in prior classes I have taken,0,wi24
"I don't really like the stress behind assignments with the hidden test cases. Even though the hidden test cases are just more of a generic check rather than edge case checks, I get stressed over misreading or overlooking a part of the instruction and missing points on the assignments. I think it would be nice if students were guaranteed a certain grade on assignments given they pass all of the visible testcases.",0,wi24
"the group project, but not bcuz my group or the project itself, just because the only time we are all available tends to be inconvenient for me",0,wi24
The weekly quizzes because they are annoying.,0,wi24
"I don't have anything dislike about COGS 108. There is only one disadvantage that our group comes from 2 sections. Therefore, it is harder for us to figure a common time to work on together weekly.",0,wi24
"So far, I feel that some Jupyter notebook assignments have been overly confusing. I found that me and many of my peers had trouble specifically with D3, which I think could have been fixed with cleared instructions.",0,wi24
Assigned groups. I want to work with people that I choose.,0,wi24
"The beginning part that was just Python coding review was pretty boring, since I have more of a Python background, but I understand some students don't have too much experience with Python/Github/etc.",0,wi24
"There is nothing I have disliked yet, but now that we are getting to working with statistics concepts, I foresee myself enjoying this topic a little less since I don't enjoy math much. Despite this, I see its importance and am still eager to learn it.",0,wi24
"I feel as though the labs (D2,D3....) are quite difficult and dont always cover what we did in lecture. Requires quite a bit of outside research.",0,wi24
I feel like the pacing of this course is difficult but this problem is mostly to do with the quarter system. I think it is rough that I am trying to plan a project that could or could not deploy a model when I don't yet know how to make a model.,0,wi24
"Weekly quizzes, I feel like some of the tick multiple choice questions are a bit ambiguous / hard to answer.",0,wi24
Lectures don’t feel directly related to our current work on the final project,0,wi24
"some of the assignment questions are worded confusingly, so it's hard to figure out what the question is asking for",0,wi24
It's been challenging to coordinate with my group because everyone's schedules are so busy and don't always match up.,0,wi24
"The group project is starting to feel very stressful - especially since it feels like the amount and depth of deliverables expected this week (Project Proposal) is so much more than the first week after groups were made. I'm excited for what we'll make, but I wish we had more time to work on the proposal, or were sorted into groups earlier in the quarter so we could submit the proposal before midterms (maybe week 3 or week 4 instead of week 5).",0,wi24
coding but that's because i'm a cog sci design major who hasn't taken a coding class in a few years,0,wi24
I haven't enjoyed being stuck on questions and realizing there was one small thing I needed to change.,0,wi24
"As a data science major, most of the content in the class so far has been review, making the course easier that I expected. I also would have liked if we could choose our proejct groups.",0,wi24
group project,0,wi24
"Sometimes in class, the Jupyter notebook will run into an error or say a method is out of date on my end and if I can't fix it it prevents other crucial codeblocks from running.",0,wi24
"Nothing really, so far my group is mostly been good. A couple people have been absent to meetings but they have been doing their work asynchronously.",0,wi24
Everything seems reasonable so far,0,wi24
"The instruction for labs and assignments were sometimes not very clear, which made me spend more time on the labs ans assignments",0,wi24
"Some of the discussions and assignments have vague instructions, and can sometimes be tedious to do",0,wi24
"What I liked least about COGS 108 was the first couple of review lectures on python because I already knew python so it was very boring and unnecessary; however, I understand why it is taught as many students need a refresher on python and coding",0,wi24
not being able to choose my group,0,wi24
I have least liked learning about GIthub because it was confusing to me. I didn't fully understand how to do the assignment for it in D1. I wish we could have gone more in depth with this in lecture.,0,wi24
I do not have it.,0,wi24
"Some weeks have more homework than others, I don't mind the workload but I would prefer it to be more consistent",0,wi24
A lot of things to remember and consider for my grade throughout the week,0,wi24
"Learning how to use these new libraries and methods, but still somewhat enjoyable.",0,wi24
I have least enjoyed coding (as a non-computer science major).,0,wi24
"I like that the deadlines are all due midnight of Sunday for each week, although this can sometimes be tricky as working in a group for the project, things tend to be left for the weekend, which can be tricky to navigate last minute.",0,wi24
There hasn’t been much that I’ve really disliked so far.,0,wi24
Some part of the assignment is a little bit hard for me. But I will work it out.,0,wi24
clicker questions,0,wi24
"Sometimes I feel like the content in the labs doesn't reflect what we learn in class; in lab D3 I ran into a task I didn't know how to implement. I read documentation, but documentation can be gnarly to sort through at times.",0,wi24
I don't have anything particular in mind.,0,wi24
I have no complaints I feel like the amount of work we are given is fair.,0,wi24
What I like least about COGS 108 are the assignments. I fairly new to pandas and seaborn so I spend a lot of time looking up the syntax and functions to understand what I am doing.,0,wi24
"I strongly dislike working with my team, as they are pretty unresponsive and disengaged. I think it would be great to have teams assigned within sections so that it is easy to meet in person, since I think that type of interaction is much more conducive to a positive group dynamic than the occasional discord voice chat",0,wi24
Assigned groups for the project. We should be able to choose who we work with,0,wi24
Some of my groupmates are not pulling their weight,0,wi24
I feel like the length of the quizzes have increased and the time it takes me to complete them has gotten longer. I wish the time allocated to do the quizzes could be extended by like a minute! But overall everything has been pretty smoothly with the class.,0,wi24
"I would say that I like the assignments the least because they do not tell me if my answers are right. They just tell me if my answers are in the correct format, but not if what I have done is correct. This means that I am not sure if what I have done is the correct thing or if I truly understand the content.",0,wi24
GitHub because I found it confusing,0,wi24
Nothing major that I don't like about this course. I would say having all the assignments due on the same day kind of stresses me out sometimes.,0,wi24
"Personally I'm not the best at coding and the fact that we're just thrown in with pandas, seaborn, and other packages, I'm not used to it, and it has been a year since I've taken a coding class so I feel lost and extremely stuck most of the time. Content will be mentioned during lecture and I understand it but it doesn't stick... then when it comes to applying it with assignments (labs specifically), I feel extremely stuck. And sometimes hopeless (if I'm being honest). 

Moreover, when it comes to labs, I have a hard time understanding certain prompts and what it asks of me (but that could just be a personal problem, who knows)",0,wi24
"The labs and assignments often reference or require things not covered in lecture. While I understand prior knowledge of programming is expected, it would be nice to see some more methods/topics mentioned. There were a few times I would wonder if I was ""supposed to"" or ""allowed to"" use a certain method since it was not covered.",0,wi24
I don't really like how all the assignments are due on the same day.,0,wi24
"Nothing really, its a great course!",0,wi24
"Interpretation of data. It's just that analyzing the data sometimes has some pretty strange results, so maybe I need to learn more about statistics.",0,wi24
"multiple different assignments, would be easy to miss an assignment if i'm not careful",0,wi24
"Not really anything, I think it's been good.",0,wi24
"I don't necessary dislike anything but I find the length of assignments are a bit long which might not be necessary to promote learning. Although it is completely understandable for the assignments to be broken down into step by step, having too many of them took away the motivation for me to explore and test on my own. By the end of the assignment, I just wanted to move on. To be fair, I always try to finish them in 1 sitting which might not be what the assignment intended to be. Having multiple smaller assignment might helps (ex. pre-lecture, post-lecture)?",0,wi24
"Some members in team project do not participate or communicate, leaving me and other members to complete the work.",0,wi24
Nothing really.,0,wi24
"My project group seemed sort of uninterested when we met last time, so the final project might be more difficult than expected.",0,wi24
"So far, everything is fine to me!",0,wi24
D3 was fairly difficult and I feel like would have been nearly impossible if I was not able to make it to a lab that week.,0,wi24
Don't have any least favorite thing about the class. Every activities or PA seems to be reasonable and good practice for the final project.,0,wi24
"Nothing, everything has been really interesting and more importantly practical",0,wi24
would have been nice to have lectures online during rain,0,wi24
Attendance in class?,0,wi24
"Sometimes it can be hard to understand how to get the intended output in labs and assignments, but it is expected and I can always go to lab hours if needed.",0,wi24
There's nothing that immediately comes to mind and I appreciate how flexible the professor is with the attendance policy. I was wondering if the discussion section slides or tips are shared anywhere if we can't make it to one of them.,0,wi24
I am not sure why things covered in guest lecture appears on the weekly quiz. I thought guest lectures are extra credit.,0,wi24
I dislike how the project based portion of the class occurs outside of class time. It feels like it's harder to work at the same time as a group.,0,wi24
"data set up process, I think it's boring",0,wi24
Everything is nice so far.,0,wi24
"There are a lot of smaller assignments to keep track of (e.g., quiz, lab, assignment, group project), so it could be nice to combine some into one submission",0,wi24
Not really.,0,wi24
"The assigned groups for the project, I understand that the experience working with people we do not know can be useful but I was hoping to work with people I am anticipating on working with for my DSC capstone sequence to see how I like working with them. Also the differing skill levels in terms of coding does make me a little nervous as to how the project is going to go.",0,wi24
It's kind of difficult to have everything due at once but it does make it easier to remember the deadline.,0,wi24
I dislike that instructions are not specific.,0,wi24
I just generally dislike group projects.,0,wi24
"Nothing too extreme, but some of the assignments seem to run a little long and the instructions aren't always very clear for them. Not a major concern but would probably be my least.",0,wi24
It would be nice if the instructions in the assignments could be more detailed.,0,wi24
I do not like having to pay for an iclicker.,0,wi24
The pace is a bit slow,0,wi24
So many assignments paired with stricter late policies and grading for correctness and over strict grading scheme. Lots to juggle,0,wi24
"My least favorite part of the class so far has been the some of the pandas/numpy documentation that i have head to read through online . A lot of this documentation does not have examples so it is a bit hard to completely understand what each method does at first glance. This no fault of the class, but it has been my least favorite part of doing the class.",0,wi24
I don't like the quizzes due on sundays.,0,wi24
I have least liked the lectures because sometimes I find it hard to always pay attention and that they are a little slow and not focused on programming,0,wi24
"It can be hard to get comfortable and in a working relationship with the group, especially in the time frame and manner approached in this class. It would have been nice to have known the groups earlier, or had some more organized or structured way of forcing groups to meet.",0,wi24
"Scheduling with group and trying to get everyone on the same page. I think this is just the nature of working with others and trying to get the project started, but personally it is somewhat frustrating trying to schedule and get a hold of everyone with little effort given back.",0,wi24
I would prefer if quizzes were released after the 9:00am lecture,0,wi24
"It would be great for the group project to not be randomly assigned but rather determined by skillset, so each team would have a couple people who know how to code, others who are more creative, etc.",0,wi24
Wish we learnt more about statistical methods that can be used,0,wi24
"I feel that a portion of the assignments have code written for us and is often confusing to understand what it actually does without struggling with it for awhile, I especially wish that we had more practice with data acquisition and cleaning as it's done for us.",0,wi24
I think the project groups should've been formed earlier so we can get started earlier and have more time to finish.,0,wi24
Comparatively concept heavy material is my least favorite as I enjoy learning more actively learning required material like playing around with datasets or generating figures.,0,wi24
The group project as I don't like working in assigned groups as it can lead to a mismatch in skills and more importantly effort levels.,0,wi24
"I am generally struggling with assignments, but that could just be a me thing. I am used to having programming classes where there are tutor hours that I can go to for debugging rather than having labs. Unfortunately, I mostly only have time to get most of my work done on the weekend and it feels scary to not have a synchronous help option then. Also, am used to pair programming more, so maybe that's why I'm struggling more.",0,wi24
Some of the instructions for assignments can't be a bit unclear sometimes. There are so many ways to do one problem,0,wi24
"The group project feels like it has gone from 0 to 100 really quickly. Half of our group had not met or contributed anything until our meeting three days ago, so the pace that we will need to keep for this project worries me.",0,wi24
I did feel a little intimidated by some of the projects we reviewed and their code,0,wi24
Quizzes.,0,wi24
So far nothing stands out particularly. I don't enjoy group projects that much but I think its good practice working with a group.,0,wi24
"I like least about the random assignment of groups for the final project because before working together effectively, it takes time to get to know each other and everyone's working style. Although it is a good opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone, working with people I'm less familiar with takes me more time to produce a high-quality result with my team.",0,wi24
The amount of redundancy in coding.,0,wi24
A little confusion with some homework problems.,0,wi24
I don't have anything I particularly dislike.,0,wi24
"The group project feels daunting. But, I also am excited to hopefully have something cool to put on my resume, so I don't feel awful. It's just a bit anxiety provoking.",0,wi24
The actual coding part. It all goes through one ear out the other.,0,wi24
I have least liked the group projects as I'm not a huge fan of group work in general. It can be hard at times to find matching schedules and be constantly in communication with everyone,0,wi24
"The class is too early in the morning, sometime it is hard to make it to the class.",0,wi24
"datahub/juypter notebook, it can act up sometimes",0,wi24
"Using Github, Github desktop, etc.

Every aspect of the class is nice except using Github and cloning, pushing, pulling, committing, etc.",0,wi24
Nothing I don't like so far(maybe the 9:00 AM lecture lol coz I have to get up early),0,wi24
I think so far everything is good.,0,wi24
There's not really anything I haven't liked,0,wi24
"Too many assignments each week, I wish we could've combined some assignments to make it easier to keep track of what I need to complete on a week to week basis.",0,wi24
"I don't like how much work there is, especially with the amount of assignments that are piled on for this class (i.e. having to do all discussion labs and assignments and quizzes in a week). Also, I don't like having assigned groups when there are people who aren't responsive and don't take responsibility because it feels hopeless in what to do when people don't want to pull their weight.",0,wi24
"I think I would have preferred picking groups for the final project over being assigned random groups, but my group is still really nice",0,wi24
Finding time to meet up with my group. I feel like because everyone has their own lives and sleeping schedules/ work schedules it is sometimes difficult to allocate time to work on the projects. Also because our meetings tend to last longer than expected so it cuts into all of our other plans.,0,wi24
The weekly labs - they feel a bit tedious to get through.,0,wi24
the lecture content does not help in completing the lsbs and assignments,0,wi24
"Nothing so far, I feel like I have enjoyed everything about COGS 108 as of right now",0,wi24
I am not really sure what I least like so far.,0,wi24
Everything is great so far,0,wi24
"In person attendance being part of a grade is difficult for me as I live a few cities away in SD county, so I'm just taking the loss of percentage to save on money haha.",0,wi24
Trying to teach myself python at the same time. I feel like I'm always behind and much of the work takes a lot of studying and referencing other sources to figure out what's going on - but this is due to me not knowing Python.,0,wi24
There are two assignments and a quiz due every week.,0,wi24
Working with random group members on big projects. It is difficult to communicate sometimes and wok together as we don't know each other before.,0,wi24
"I don't like the theoretical part because theoretical stuff is hard for me to understand. But I understand that it's necessary for the class to help us understand data science in many perspectives, not just about data.",0,wi24
"So far, group communication and planning for the project has not been great, as some of my group members have not been engaged with the process so far.",0,wi24
"I don't think I have anything that I dislike about COGS 108, I enjoy all of the class.",0,wi24
"I think sometimes some of the labs are difficult to complete. Although I know that it is intentionally vague and that some concepts are things we didn't go over and are supposed to search online for, sometimes I struggle for a long time without step by step instruction. Because there's also multiple ways to do something, oftentimes when I look online, they'll give solutions that are much lengthier and more confusing than necessary. I completely understand that this is part of the whole process, but I'd say this has been the most frustrating part of this class.",0,wi24
"I find many of the discussion assignments to be ambiguous. For example, the congress workbook had lots of parts where it was not very clear what we should plot, since much of the language about e.g. ""broken down by"", was unclear.",0,wi24
I find that sometimes the assignments/discussion may be a bit vague as to what is being asked of me. While I am able to use the expected test results as a guideline it would be beneficial if the instruction were clear enough for me to not have to resort to that.,0,wi24
"The amount of work. I think there is a lot of assigned tasks which make it difficult to focus on the project. It is very time-consuming to focus on the quizzes, discussion work, and assignments along with the group project assignments. For example, this week was very difficult because we had three personal assignments and needed to decide a research topic with our groups/create a proposal. 

A solution I propose is having a week to only think about the research and just submit the question in a google form style. Then, the next week assign the proposal.",0,wi24
I liked the quizzes the least. Some questions were confusing,0,wi24
Discussion - Sometimes a bit too complicated at times,0,wi24
not really,0,wi24
I keep forgetting to bring my iClicker with me and am showing up to lectures without getting any participation credit...,0,wi24
"Group work, can be frustrating at times to coordinate with everyone, especially when everything we've done together has been online and individualized",0,wi24
the group project with random classmates has been hard to coordinate since no one is that responsive,0,wi24
"Most classes largely cover topics I already know, but I am also coming into this class with a lot of prior knowledge",0,wi24
I don't like how we can't pick our groups for project :(,0,wi24
"It might be the group work. We're a little behind, but this could be from all of us having a heavy week last, but still were hoping to start more work this upcoming week.",0,wi24
"Not having a hybrid option during rainy days. I understand that we have up to 5 days to skip, but the rain lasted a couple lectures and it would've been more convenient to have that option. But I still appreciate the amount of days you give to skip!",0,wi24
I think having Assignments and coding labs is a little redundant and the assignments are lengthy when I would rather put that time towards the project,0,wi24
The least part about COGS 108 is the discussion work as some of them was confusing and not having all the test case available to us is also kinda annoying because I wanted to double check my work before submitting.,0,wi24
The hidden tests since I lost points and didn't know why even though my code ran through valid,0,wi24
nothing too bad,0,wi24
I dislike how the assignments are once every other week but is opened the week that is due. This makes it uneven in terms of work load and rather it be opened for 2 weeks so the work doesn't pile up.,0,wi24
sometimes the labs and assignments have really vague/ambiguous descriptions on the task and that makes me struggle to understand what it wants me to do,0,wi24
The groups are randomly assigned.,0,wi24
nothing yet,0,wi24
The organization of the class. The group project feels very disconnected from the class itself and it's a bit disorienting.,0,wi24
collaborative assignments with group.,0,wi24
"Nothing, so far so good",0,wi24
Some assignment questions too complicated,0,wi24
Using datahub; it has been inconsistent in saving my progress in assignments and discussions.,0,wi24
I have been disliking how the questions in the labs and assignments sometimes sound like riddles. I find myself sitting there at my computer spending more time wondering what the question is asking me to do than actually writing the code.,0,wi24
"Well, I understand why we get assigned teammates for the group project, and in real life it is indeed that we don't have choices. But just for this class, I still liked the least about being unable to choose my own teammates.",0,wi24
I think that the discussion assignments can become tedious at times even after using course/online resources to write code.,0,wi24
I wish we could've spent a little more time recapping python basics and having relevant methods that aren't talked about in class mentioned a bit more on the assignment instructions.,0,wi24
I think that maybe groups could've been assigned slightly earlier in the quarter so we had more time to figure it out with groups.,0,wi24
I have found the discussion assignments and the actual assignments really repetitive because they are generally the same assignments.,0,wi24
"I struggle a bit with the assignments, but I wouldn't say that I don't like the process of tackling the problem and figuring out solution.",0,wi24
"I think groups can be divided based on topics of interest. I hope this final project will be beneficial for my future work and life. However, being assigned to very random groups means that each person's interests may not align well, leading to members who are not sensitive to the topic being unable to fully engage. I understand that in future work, employees cannot choose the content of their work, but I believe that schools can provide a platform for students to fully immerse themselves in topics they are genuinely interested in, considering there are decades of mandatory work content waiting for students to complete in the future",0,wi24
The thing I like the least about COGS 108 is the group project because the groups were randomly assigned.,0,wi24
There is not a part of COGS 108 that I do not like as I feel like the class in very manageable.,0,wi24
"So far, the trajectory of the project seems unclear to me, but I feel like that's only because that's more focussed on towards the end of the quarter",0,wi24
I really enjoy the course so far but the 9 AM lecture time is not my favorite (I'm not a morning person at all).,0,wi24
"I don't like how much is due every Sunday. I wished that instead of having a lab due every week, it was only due the weeks where there wasn't an exam.",0,wi24
"The weekly quizzes, they really just stress me out.",0,wi24
What I have liked least about COGS 108 is nothing actually! I have enjoyed every single aspect of the course so far.,0,wi24
"I don't really like anything least, but I do wish I could choose my COGS 108 group since I took this class with a few friends and we wanted to do a project together.",0,wi24
There is nothing that I particularly don't like but I feel like I already know most of the content from DSC 10.,0,wi24
"The instructions on discussion and assignment notebooks are often not clear, making it extremely hard to understand what is being asked and what should be done. Directions can be interpreted in different ways.",0,wi24
"Not much honestly, I would like to know what hidden test cases are after I submit (once deadline passes), or if that is already possible- more clarity on how to find that.",0,wi24
We are randomly assigned for teammates in group project.,0,wi24
"Because I do not have much experience with python, I feel that I have been struggling quite a bit on getting the hang of everything.",0,wi24
Maybe the weekly quiz since the time for the quiz is very limited.,0,wi24
"There are inconsistencies in lecture notes that have affected my quiz grades. For example, conditionals were described as *always* having an if-else format, which would mean that you technically don't use conditionals to query a data frame (instead you would just use a boolean expression in square brackets).",0,wi24
Long assignments,0,wi24
"It feels very overwhelming so far. I have coding experience with COGS 18 and a small amount of MATLAB but the final project seems like something so far out of my reach, and it seems like my group for the project feels pretty much the same way. It's mostly the coding aspect that seems so daunting, although I do believe that we will be able to get a good grade in the end.

Additionally, with the assignments and labs I feel like there has been questions with confusing wording. Sometimes it's really hard for me to figure out what exactly the question is asking of me, or what my final product should even look like. Piazza has been a good help for this though.",0,wi24
"Some of the instructions in the labs are not very clear, so sometimes, it is kind of hard to know what exactly we are asked to do.",0,wi24
I think some questions are too wordy. Just tell me what to do or how to do.,0,wi24
The quizzes,0,wi24
There are some questions on discussions/assignments that are unclear so it makes it difficult to do them,0,wi24
Probably completing the assignments. I've done the lower division data science sequence and so redoing a lot of the same pandas stuff is just kind of a pain.,0,wi24
The flip side of the last question the one thing I don't like its feeling as if I have no clue how to do the ML algorithms present in the example final projects,0,wi24
I don't think there was anything I didn't enjoy.,0,wi24
"For D2, I spent a bit more time than I thought I would've needed to on the work because I was searching documentation for wrangling. Then I worked on A2 and realized that everything I needed in D2 was written and explained in A2. It's mostly my fault for not checking beforehand but including the explanations on the labs as well or at least a pointer to the assignments could be really helpful.",0,wi24
The final project tasks and lay out is somehow confusing,0,wi24
The really vague instructions for the labs.,0,wi24
"Despite the excitement of learning new tools and methods, the initial phase of getting comfortable with libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn, has been challenging. The pace at which new concepts are introduced sometimes feels overwhelming, especially when trying to juggle other coursework and commitments.",0,wi24
I've liked the workload the least in COGS 108 as I feel that this is a work heavy course and that there are a lot of assignments that I need to be aware of.,0,wi24
"I have liked working in a group the least. My group members like to do everything the day it is due and it is incompatible with my schedule. I would appreciate if we were able to have the option to make our own groups, so I could be with others that have a similar work ethic to me.",0,wi24
Random groups. I understand working with random people is how it is in work space but working with people I know on a project together is so much more enjoyable and easier.,0,wi24
"I don't like the group project aspect personally because even though it's a imitation of real life work and gives us good project experience, it is hard to coordinate as it's a class and not a work environment, and the projects can vary a lot which personally I like more order in.",0,wi24
"Datahub, it's somehow annoying to submit things on datahub instead of gradescope or canvas",0,wi24
So far the discussion activities haven't been my favorite just because it can be hard to follow at times. I have found that the discord has been helpful to get help from my peers but the discussion activities don't have much instruction so I can get confused at times. I understand that the goal of this is to get us looking around and communicating with each other but it can be frustrating at times.,0,wi24
The group project for sure. My teammates are really hard to work with. They have intentionally ignored me and my inputs multiple times during the project meetings. There was one time that they start to argue with each other aggressively as well. Assigned group is really challenging for introvert people.,0,wi24
I think it would have been more fun to choose our own groups or at least choose based on a topic.,0,wi24
"Nothing I can think of, everything seems fun.",0,wi24
"I'll address the iClicker questions. There were instances where all the questions were clustered at the beginning, causing me to miss them, and other times when my app crashed, preventing me from answering. It's stressful because I want the extra credit.",0,wi24
Not being able to meet new people,0,wi24
"The group project along with the assignments, quizes, and discussions is a lot all at once.",0,wi24
nothing really. I love this course!,0,wi24
I do not like that a course need use iclicker.,0,wi24
"While nothing really comes to mind, if I had to very picky it probably be how the Discussions are harder than the Assignments.",0,wi24
I think everything in COGS108 is good,0,wi24
"explanation of the data, I don't like any kind of explanation, it just not my thing.",0,wi24
"I'm kind of struggling with working with my group at the moment, but I hope it will work out once the proposal is in.",0,wi24
homework assignments can feel a little lengthy,0,wi24
"There isn't anything in particular that I dislike. Everything is pretty good. I particularly like the Sunday due date for all assignments because I don't have to try to remember when every assignment is due, which is stressful. I wish all my classes did something like that.",0,wi24
"Honestly, I really don't like group projects because I feel I often end up doing most of the work, but I do understand why they are necessary.",0,wi24
"Though I don't have anything I particularly disliked, so far the content I've struggled the most with is knowing which type of plot is best to use in which scenario(s). I think I get confused since all of the plots and information was given at the same time, and I didn't get sufficient practice with knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each one.",0,wi24
I haven't liked how early the class is because I hate waking up,0,wi24
"I don't like that the published lecture content (slides & lecture notes) don't contain much information. There aren't many examples or specifics, so it's hard to go off of and I often resort to other sources to figure out the coding assignments.",0,wi24
Nothing in particular as of late. I think all the assignments are fair and the tasks are appropriately challenging.,0,wi24
Some of the things in the discussions/assignments aren't covered in lecture or other material so I feel like I have to search around for it as I'm not that familiar with everything we are using in the class,0,wi24
I don't really like doing group project.,0,wi24
Nothing really stands out,0,wi24
I think D3 was very stressful for me since I was really confused on what data I was supposed to wrangle and how...,0,wi24
Statistics,0,wi24
Not being able to pick our group members. I understand it's for a study but at the same time it's the little inconveniences of having to schedule meetings use a platform everyone has even if it isn't a best and patiently waiting for everyone's response because you don't know them and don't want to come off mean.,0,wi24
The time it takes to understand things on assignments and figure out why something isn't working.,0,wi24
The quantity of tasks to do every week. Although it's a personal concern as I understand the reason for the inclusion of many different tasks every week and I appreciate the consistent deadline of midnight on Sunday. Have many tasks each week can often times be overwhelming as I'm always thinking about if I have completed them all.,0,wi24
I think the quiz is boring,0,wi24
I would like some more examples of manipulating seaborn and pandas,0,wi24
"I dont have much to complain, probably I'd like for there to be an easier way to navigate between course material on canvas but that's about it.",0,wi24
There's nothing I don't like in this class!,0,wi24
Some Discussion and Assignment questions feel very unclear,0,wi24
"nothing much but if i had to say one, it would probably the group project since I enjoy working alone, but so far everyone has been nice and I like my group and the project so far!",0,wi24
"The clicker questions. I was unable to come to a significant portion of lectures due to this quarter's weather conditions, so I was unable to come to most of them and participate.",0,wi24
"I like the least on the graph that we need to plot, because I am very good at them, but I will try my best to improve my skills on them.",0,wi24
"I''m not sure if theres anything I've really disliked about the course so far. I do find using github challenging because it is completely new to me, and transferring files for the group project can be difficult for me.",0,wi24
I really dislike the quizzes because I sometimes forget to take them.,0,wi24
The weekly quizzes that ask us both very general and specific questions,0,wi24
I think the least favorite about Cogs 108 so far is using datahub and jupiter notebook. It disconnect a lot and slow as well.,0,wi24
Sometimes the labs/assignments have instructions that are a bit too vague like in D4 there were some code blocks that I did not know what to fill out because the instructions were not too clear,0,wi24
"So far, I think everything is fine. I don’t have anything don’t like yet.",0,wi24
too many assignments due each sunday,0,wi24
Having to organize group meetings can be tedious,0,wi24
I feel that sometimes we pass over certain topics about programming methods and tools rather quickly.,0,wi24
I find the lectures kind of boring since a lot of this stuff has been something I have learned already.,0,wi24
I want to learn a bit more about the technical parts,0,wi24
"Honestly, as a CS major taking this for an elective, I really just wanted to work with friends on the project. I feel less motivated and I care less about the project topic. I will still do my work of course, but it will be out of obligation rather than interest.",0,wi24
I mean the speed is something that you have to get used to here at UCSD because of the quarter system but I do think that it's pretty fast which makes it difficult sometimes.,0,wi24
lab/assignment instructions can be unclear; sometimes feeling like we have to google everything ourselves/self-teach to complete the work (concepts/methods not explained in lecture or discussion),0,wi24
"The thing that I have enjoyed the least has nothing to do with the class, it has to do with the weather. My plan was to attend every single lecture in person but with the past rains it has made it hard to do so.",0,wi24
"I dont like how all the information is spread out through different websites, canavs, github, piazza.",0,wi24
I don't have anything I like least about COGS 108!,0,wi24
nothing,0,wi24
The thing I have liked the least about this class so far is not having designated time to work on the final project.,0,wi24
too much work,0,wi24
"the group project, i don't like talking to random people & it's been kinda stressful so far trying to coordinate with them",0,wi24
Group work so far. There's no problem with my group but I personally do not like group work in general.,0,wi24
The lectures go over general topics but I think practical problems that can be solved in class and then talked about with a partner and then explained by you would help us understand the topics better,0,wi24
My group project has a lot of different majors so working together is harder than expected,0,wi24
"The weekly quiz, discussions, and assignments are a little bit stressful to keep up with each week.",0,wi24
The assignments are difficult so I have least enjoyed them.,0,wi24
"Sometimes it's a bit confusing to remember the parameters that need to be passed for different functions, and also confusing to remember which functions belong to what libraries or which ones will be best to use.",0,wi24
The lack of structured information and instruction on pandas and seaborn has really left me confused at times regarding assignments.,0,wi24
Discussion PA's,0,wi24
coding,0,wi24
"Discussion homework, it is time consuming.",0,wi24
The assigned group project - I truly would have had such a better experience being able to pick a group or just work by myself.,0,wi24
There is nothing,0,wi24
"The pacing seems off in my opinion. I feel that most of what we've learned so far has not prepared us to produce a final project--at the time of writing that is. So far we've only really covered basic pandas operations data vis, and some statistics concepts.",0,wi24
This class is perfect. Nothing don't like.,0,wi24
"Trying to collaborate with teammates for the project; I don't mean to call out my teammates, but I feel like it is hard to meet at a time when everyone is available.",0,wi24
Finding good data for our topic was a challenge.,0,wi24
I felt like some of the quiz questions were a bit vague.,0,wi24
"the group project is a bit tough just due to the lack of structure, I previously took cse110 before and we had designated group leaders which made it easier as they helped delegate the work. I know it could backfire if some leaders were too bossy for example, but I think I'd prefer being able to be told what needs to be done as opposed to the whole group kind of lost and willing to do whatever on their own.",0,wi24
Making graphs,0,wi24
I like the lecture quizzes the least because they're not as fun,0,wi24
Github. It is too messy to work with.,0,wi24
"The part I least enjoyed was learning how to plot. To me, plotting is not intuitive and takes a long time for me to understand.",0,wi24
random teammate,0,wi24
the learning of pandas library,0,wi24
"The random groups were a bummer, since I really wanted to work with my friends on the final project.",0,wi24
What i’ve liked the least is not necessarily too hard but it’s all i could think of : learning how to navigate github with my group for the first time. I think i’ll get the hang of it after using it more often now that we’re starting project proposals,0,wi24
The extra credit offered in the class could be increased by a bit,0,wi24
"If I had to say something, I disliked jupyter notebooks the least with how slow it takes to run code can be a little frustrating.",0,wi24
group project,0,wi24
A lot of things toi be keeping track of,0,wi24
"It has been hard to keep up with the material. However, I have been trying my best to catch up. The project looks like a lot of fun though!",0,wi24
Clicker credit to get EC instead of a live/free website,0,wi24
I think data manipulation is the least I like for the class because I have no prior experience in panda,0,wi24
Probably hard to find a time to group with the groupmates.,0,wi24
It was a little hard to formulate a research question and find appropriate datasets but we figured it out.,0,wi24
"It's not what I liked least, but more so hardest part is probably thinking of an effective, data-driven research question for our final topic. My group initially had ""How does the rise of automation influence the skills needed to keep a job?"" (something along those lines) However, the datasets we found were all very web-scrappy and since the issue is still so new, we couldn't find raw data. A lot of the web-scrappy parts were finalized data. We tried to reverse psychology their findings by going through their references but didn't find anything at all.",0,wi24
"Working in a team. I'd rather have less or same amount of work for myself, since I know if I miss a deadline, it is entirely my fault, and I don't have to rely on other people either not responding or couldn't make the deadline for one reason or another.",0,wi24
The submission system is kind of annoying.,0,wi24
Why are the weekly lecture quizzes released Friday afternoon? I work really hard during the week so I can enjoy my weekends and I would prefer to take the quiz immediately after Friday morning lecture at 0955.,0,wi24
Heavy workload.,0,wi24
Possibly the multiple modalities for the class/homework material to be in. Sometimes you have to really search to find the exact course material you wanted. But no big complaints truly!,0,wi24
"I do not like how we have several assignments every other week and it can easily pile up. It tends to be piled on when other classes get busy as well. For example, one week is really light and easy and the next week we have a quiz, discussion assignment, our actual assignment, and then we have to also work on our projects.",0,wi24
"The group project, I completely understand why we do it in groups, but I just in general do not enjoy doing group work.",0,wi24
not being able to choose project groups,0,wi24
i don't like how i can't see how well i did on the weekly quizzes after i do them,0,wi24
I don't really have anything I dislike about the class.,0,wi24
I didn't like that groups were assigned as I would've liked it better if we could choose or had the option to choose to be assigned if not.,0,wi24
I sometimes feel some of the wording for some assignment/discussion questions is too ambiguous and some could be refined to be more specific of what the question is asking mostly with proper formatting for the answers.,0,wi24
I don't like how we were randomly sorted into groups for the group project.,0,wi24
"I don't really have any negative experience so far for the course, or anything that I least like.",0,wi24
I would say the thing that has been the most difficult for me so far has definitely been completing the assignments for our group project as it has been challenging at times to find times to meet up and has also been stressful to trust that everyone in my group would finish their assigned parts of our group assignments.,0,wi24
So far I have the class slightly disorganized as I have been a little confused on how to submit assignments.,0,wi24
"Some of the questions on the assignments are tough, but that is honestly understandable and normal.",0,wi24
class is too bored,0,wi24
"The amount of deadlines in a week can be kind of stressful, as the labs, assignments, and quizzes stack on top of the group project is quite a heavy workload (with other courses in mind as well).",0,wi24
I don't like randomly assigned group,0,wi24
Lots of things to do each week,0,wi24
The group work unfortunately has been a bit hard. The randomness hit my group hard where some members put in the bare minimum when it comes to discussion. We've gotten far but meetings aren't as productive. I personally would enjoy selecting my team (but I am curious about the study results on random versus selecting groups goes),0,wi24
"I think I have disliked the beginning part of the COGS project because it seemed a bit messy to contact with one another through canvas. In addition, I was personally thrown off guard about the project review assignment when I recently joined my group",0,wi24

Working in group projects where an individual did not really contribute :/,0,wi24
"The slightly more theoretical lectures, although they were still very interesting!",0,wi24
"I think some of the course content is very broad and a little vague. I wish more examples about some content (like ethics and privacy) can help to get a better understanding of what to look out for, what not to do, etc. Negative examples in general would be great.",0,wi24
"So far, I don't really have any complaints. If I HAD to pick something I'd say the assignments but it's not that I DON'T like them I'm just not the best coder so it takes me some time. Otherwise it's all good.",0,wi24
"I feel that lectures are too fast, sometimes. The different concepts just fly by, so it is hard to keep up with the information being typed into the Jupyter Notebook.",0,wi24
the hw too much text to read,0,wi24
So far so good,0,wi24
Sometimes lines of code are not explained and I,0,wi24
"Its kind of hard to take notes and keep track of things when there are slides, jupyternotebooks, etc. Not really sure what the solution for this would be.",0,wi24
The amount and difficulty of the homework which I find challenging,0,wi24
I have least liked how some questions on the labs or assignments are a little confusing or unclear about what they want me to do.,0,wi24
Randomly assigned teammate. The work so far doesn't proceed very well.,0,wi24
"I think it may be a bit difficult combining the technical side/coding aspect of the class with the conceptual, since in lecture, the conceptual aspects of data science are emphasized but it can be difficult connecting this to python concepts, which aren't as emphasized.",0,wi24
"Although, I do see the positives in collaborating with others, I have liked working in groups the least. I think because there's so little time to get to know one another, it's hard to discover an individual's strengths and weakness to assign them to a role that they could achieve effectively. I'm learning to explain myself and to listen more to others.",0,wi24
I don't like the early times honestly.,0,wi24
That it is hard to find groupmates to do the project tgt sometimes,0,wi24
I like the discussions the least. I don't find them particularly helpful so far and it would be more effective if it encouraged discussion with other students.,0,wi24
"Not having a mandatory in person meeting for our group projects, at least for the introduction.",0,wi24
Lack of group meetings.,0,wi24
Jupyter Notebook because it's very confusing to load s,0,wi24
i just dont love how the assignments take so long and how there are hidden assignments that could secretly mess up my score.,0,wi24
the assignments are long,0,wi24
The project proposal,0,wi24
Weekly quizzes,0,wi24
I like the labs and homeworks they're pretty well structured.,1,wi25
The lectures are very entertaining and a great way to teach,1,wi25
"I have really enjoyed the further exposure to Python. I took a class using Python before but I feel like I am retaining much more information on how to use it here due to the detailed explanations provided for us in lecture, labs, and assignments. ",1,wi25
"What I have enjoyed the most so far in this class is the overall class structure. For a class like this, I love how we have the opportunity to form groups and work on one big project, with “checkpoints” throughout the quarter for the project and “small” assignments to complete weekly for the course materials (the quizzes and assignments). I think that is better than having midterms/finals.",1,wi25
How thorough lectures are and accomodating the class is for students. I feel like I am learning a great deal without adding too much stress to my workload. ,1,wi25
I've enjoyed brushing up on my pandas knowledge and I do like that the lectures themselves are quite interactive with the notebooks,1,wi25
"I like the discussion and assignment assignments. I like how I can apply what I learned in class to different samples and see the outcomes. Moreover, they are hands-on, so I can learn about the syntax and how to analyze data. ",1,wi25
Learning about the different ways of reducing or wrangling datasets.,1,wi25
Not so much about learning the language but the intuition of data. Understand that data can be biased and ethics about data analysis.,1,wi25
Assignments and Discussion Labs have been straightforward and interesting.,1,wi25
"I've most enjoyed the satisfying way discussions and assignments are set up, along with the beneficial lectures given by prof. ellis.",1,wi25
"I enjoy the class a lot, there are great examples in lecture that help me understand the material. ",1,wi25
Professor Ellis does a really good job explaining things and articulating concepts.,1,wi25
the specializations per week and the teaching staff's openness to questions,1,wi25
I have enjoyed the assignments. As a data science major I feel like I’m getting extra practice from both this class and my data science classes so I really understand the content.,1,wi25
Meeting new people and refreshing my mind about python.,1,wi25
I have enjoyed this class a lot which is surprising because data science and coding is not my strong suit. I am motivated to learn in this class because Prof Ellis makes lectures engaging and keeps the class well organized. I like the fact that we have in class surveys because it motivates me to not only just go to class but also to pay attention. I also appreciate the structure of the class. Everything is well organized I know what is due and when it is due which allows me to always have my own schedule revolving when to get my work done.,1,wi25
I enjoy how structured the class is. It's very clear when things are due and what is expected of us. I also appreciate the reminders at the beginning of each lecture.,1,wi25
"One thing that I have enjoyed the most about COGS 108 is how helpful Professor Ellis is during office hours; the professor alone makes this class much more enjoyable and for students who do not have much prior coding experience, much less intimidating.",1,wi25
The in class participation/real time data analyses have been fun and informative,1,wi25
"I’ve enjoyed learning about how specifically to use programming to clean up data sets, leading to an answer for an important question.",1,wi25
"The content has been fun. Data science is completely new to me, so it's interesting to learn about data, even though it seems intimidating and extremely tedious.",1,wi25
"So far I have enjoyed learning about the different visualizations and using Pandas the most. While I have experience in coding, I have not experienced using code for data visualizations. I found this interesting and engaging.",1,wi25
"I like the lab assignments. They are short, easy to understand, and honestly have helped me learn the code better. ",1,wi25
I liked the pace of the lecture and how its preparing us for the projects,1,wi25
I enjoyed learning about the different graphs we can plot and how that information can help us learn more about the data we are working with. ,1,wi25
"I like that there is an incentive to make groups, because it helps me meet new people. I also like that we are using Python.",1,wi25
The hands-on aspect,1,wi25
I've enjoyed the structure of it,1,wi25
"I have enjoyed Professor Ellis' lectures because she has a funny personality. She makes learning in this class more engaging and interesting, and I appreciate her witty comments. She also is very open to discussion and questions, and encourages us to talk with others. She is patient and explains topics very well, as well as is very knowledgeable when answering our questions. ",1,wi25
I like that we have weekly practice problems to do in Datahub because it really helps me understand what we learn in class. I also like that we can attend any discussion which is more flexible for our schedules.,1,wi25
"I never really understood the concept of data science and how connected it is to computer science. I have prior Python coding knowledge, but I never fully understood how data science works, so I would say that that is the thing I enjoyed most learning in COGS 108. I also like working on group projects just because it enhances my collaborative skills and makes doing the assignments a little easier, I guess.",1,wi25
I enjoyed learning how to use pandas. I really liked using the functions and seeing the visualizations appear when I run the code.,1,wi25
I’ve enjoyed learning about the real life applications of data science and its ethical implications. ,1,wi25
"I've enjoyed the assignments the most because I feel like I learn the most from doing them. Though they're quite challenging and time consuming at times, it's good practice and I feel like I'm making good use of my time and learning new skills and topics I didn't quite know before.",1,wi25
Just learning about coding is fun and challenging,1,wi25
I liked the previous project review as it gave me a lot of direction and an idea on how to approach the overall Final Project. ,1,wi25
"Applications to research, especially regarding ethics! As someone in research, it’s always nice hearing how to prevent adverse effects resulting from publications.",1,wi25
I have enjoyed the interactive questions because of the extra credit and sometimes because I do learn content that is discussed in class. I also like that we get to be in groups for the final project. ,1,wi25
I enjoyed learning about the many aspects of data ethics and how it can have very negative impacts in the real world. I thought the inclusion of the real world examples mixed with listening to the lecture by DJ Patil gave me a deep understanding of the importance of not abusing your responsibilities. ,1,wi25
"The lectures! They use relevant examples to explain concepts to make class engaging. Also, the guest lectures provided a unique perspective on the data science field.",1,wi25
I have mostly enjoyed doing the assignments and discussions because I like how they make me think outside the box and they are also deepening my pandas knowledge which i enjoy.,1,wi25
LEARNING A NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND VISUALIZING DATA,1,wi25
I have enjoyed lectures where we interact with jupyter notebooks,1,wi25
I like the lectures and how they are interactive.,1,wi25
We are working on Jupyter for homework and lab which is practicing a lot for coding skills.,1,wi25
"lectures because of things like the examples used, the way the professor lectures, and the engagement",1,wi25
"I think ive enjoyed the teaching style and work load, its a very ""make your bed and lie in it"" kind of class if you want to you can just watch lectures and do notebooks alone or you can be more hands on but at the end of the day it allows you to make your own bed so to speak.",1,wi25
I enjoy completing the labs and assignments. The process of applying what we learned in class is the most enjoyable part for me. My favorite lectures are also the coding-based ones. I particularly liked the data wrangling lecture.,1,wi25
I've really like the content of the lecture once we started having lecture with the jupyter notebooks. I like learning more about visualizations and started to get more complex programming. Overall I really like the class structure and it makes planning my week a lot easier. ,1,wi25
"What I have enjoyed most so far is the team collaboration, this class has allowed me to meet new people. ",1,wi25
I've enjoyed the lectures. This is my second class with Professor Ellis and she is the only professor I commit full attendance to. ,1,wi25
I like learning about pandas because I think it’s interesting. I also like having a group to work with for the project because I feel like I have a community to reach out to when I’m stuck.,1,wi25
I have enjoyed coming to lectures since they are engaging and not boring. I feel like I learn a lot from following along with the notebook and answering the google form questions. The course feels well organized and I can tell prof is prepared and cares about our learning.,1,wi25
I enjoyed meeting new people in my group project because it's difficult to get to know people in my classes aside from discussion sections and lecture. Our group has been very successful in meeting every week and have shared more informal contact information as well. ,1,wi25
I like that this is a very project focused class as I have always wondered how to go about doing a data science project. I also like that we get to meet new people to do projects in this class.,1,wi25
I enjoyed coming to lecture and learning all different aspects about data science.,1,wi25
I have enjoyed the format of lectures and how the assignments reflect what we learn. I appreciate how clear it is when and what assignments are due each week. I also have been enjoying the topics in this course.,1,wi25
So far I have enjoyed working with my group. Together we have created a good project proposal and have a good rhythm of working together. ,1,wi25
Learning Pandas,1,wi25
I like the access to notes and professor makes lectures engaging,1,wi25
Seeing code create graphs ,1,wi25
I've enjoyed the most in trying out the different codes (organizing & filtering graphs),1,wi25
"I have enjoyed familiarizing myself with csv., and the basics of coding.",1,wi25
"I like that the pace of the class is digestible, the class doesn’t go too fast nor too slow. ",1,wi25
I love the project aspect so far! It's fun to meet people and try to find a common question to answer.,1,wi25
SO FAR SO GOOD! I enjoyed working on the group project with my group mates because we are working as a team and everyone has a specialty in some areas.,1,wi25
I enjoy how the workload is very manageable and the assignments and quizzes are reasonable as well. ,1,wi25
"I enjoyed working with my group mates on the project, discussing what we want to accomplish is fun.",1,wi25
I liked that all assignments are due on the same day every week which makes it consistent.,1,wi25
I like how the labs and assignments teach everything from the start rather than I assuming we know a lot beforehand. That I can work on them directly after lectures without feeling lost or needing to self-learn a lot through Google.,1,wi25
Professor Ellis's enthusiasm and excitement to share her knowledge in class. It makes the material much more interesting and feel like it's worth learning.,1,wi25
"I've enjoyed data visualization most so far, I think partially since it was really fun getting to learn a new Python library and the different formats that took. I also thought it was cool actually making our own graphs and plots, especially going from just a few lines of code to a visualization that would take quite a bit of time to hand-draw/things along that line.",1,wi25
"I have liked the step by step homework. I am not the best coder there is, so the step by step has really helped me understand what to do and what not to do. It has also helped my coding abilities",1,wi25
"Getting familiar with packages in python (pandas, seaborne, etc)",1,wi25
I think the coding skills such as the pandas and numpy libraries are pretty useful especially for future work. These skills can be generalized beyond the scope of class. I can use it in lab and work.,1,wi25
I enjoy being able to understand what data science is and being able to practice by using it in the assignments and discussion labs. I also enjoy getting to do hands on data visualization with real data. ,1,wi25
"I've enjoyed the format of the class, especially that we are given projects and assignments instead of in person tests which allows for a self-directed educational experience.",1,wi25
"I like how there is a big project as the main assignment for the course. I think it is a lot more useful than taking a midterm and final and likely forgetting most of the information after the tests. Doing a project seems more interactive and helpful, especially if we include it on our resumes. ",1,wi25
"How organized and engaging the class is. I like how clearly the assignments and deadlines are structured. Professor Ellis also makes attending in-person more fun by making the lectures more interactive, encouraging participation, and connecting the material to real life examples. ",1,wi25
I would say the project planning and journey in trying to make a nice project that fun for me and the rest of my group. ,1,wi25
I have most enjoyed starting to work on the projects as I am able to to use my data science skills on a fascinating project.,1,wi25
I have really enjoyed the assignments on datahub because they have made sure that I am applying what I have learned.,1,wi25
"The detail that you go through in lecture really helps, and I really like that when a student asks a question during lecture you make sure the whole class understands what is being asked and also the answer that you provide. Lab assignments really help prepare and understand the regular assignments.",1,wi25
I think my favorite things so far has been the 7 free late days because it alleviates stress,1,wi25
I like the collaboration aspect of the class. I like the new people I met. ,1,wi25
"Working on the final project with the team, since there is a nice team collaboration experience going on right now. People are contributing all together and putting this final project together. ",1,wi25
"The interactiveness of the class, such as discussions with class mates about poll questions.",1,wi25
"I find the coding assignments and labs easy to understand, granted I have previous coding experience.",1,wi25
Learning about Python libraries like Pandas and Numpy,1,wi25
The labs because it is easy to see if you did them correctly or not.,1,wi25
I've enjoyed working with my group. They have been helpful and we all work together well. ,1,wi25
The thing that I've enjoyed most about Cogs 108 is learning more about data science as I had now prior experience in it.,1,wi25
I like that the project is the main component of this class instead of exams. I also like that the project can be something we can add to our resumes,1,wi25
how to manage data,1,wi25
I really enjoyed doing the labs. I like how they provided step by step instructions and guide to each topic. It was completely easy to understand and I really liked this format or learning.,1,wi25
The collaborative chatting tie during class where we discuss answers to questions ,1,wi25
We have labs and assignments to practice coding and skills we need in preparation for the project. ,1,wi25
"I have enjoyed the participation and class talk the most in COGS 108 because it allows me to put to practice what I learn, instead of just listening to lecture. I like learning through practice, so listening alone makes me forget easily.",1,wi25
I like how we get to discuss with other people during lecture,1,wi25
Working together in a group and learning how to develop in a team using Github,1,wi25
I enjoy the active learning aspect of lectures. I'm unfortunately very familiar with lectures that lose my attention very easily and don't have a lot of active learning. ,1,wi25
Interesting material? I don't have much experience with data science so I think it's interesting to learn all the different ways of gathering and organizing data.,1,wi25
I like that the notebooks and assignments are straightforward and easy to follow along. ,1,wi25
"Yes, I learn a lot on how to propose interesting data science question, consider about ethic and stakeholders and coding",1,wi25
Learing about how to visualize the data.,1,wi25
I enjoy the lectures because they make the material easier to understand and I enjoy the participation stuff. It's actually interesting and I learn a lot from it.,1,wi25
I've enjoyed how it explains the practical application of what we're doing.,1,wi25
The flow of the class,1,wi25
Lectures,1,wi25
I've enjoyed getting more hands on experience coding. Completing the labs and the assignments are making me feel more confident in my data science skills. ,1,wi25
lectures are fun and informative,1,wi25
I think the Labs in this course is pretty useful ,1,wi25
Practicality. I like how I can immediately see the results of my actions through code presented in data science applications such as jupyter notebooks.,1,wi25
"I have enjoyed learning about coding in a simple, effective way. The class takes everything at a time, it is not overwhelming. ",1,wi25
The opportunity to learn very valuable tools like numpy and python. ,1,wi25
The Labs were very helpful in providing opportunities to practice technical techniques covered in class and prepare for the assignments.,1,wi25
I've enjoyed learning about the real-world applications of data science.,1,wi25
I’ve enjoyed the process of developing a project proposal and learning about the different data science methods we can apply. It’s exciting to think about how we’ll use these tools in our future projects.,1,wi25
"Probably learning about data visualization and git, feels like stuff that I will use again and again in future classes, personal projects, or in a work environment.",1,wi25
I like working with Pandas and the datasets,1,wi25
I most enjoyed being able to go to discussions whenever I need extra help on my discussion labs. It makes it easier for students who don't like going one-on-one with TA's during office hours to get aid. ,1,wi25
The flexibility is amazing ,1,wi25
Being able to work in groups and having a very open ended final project,1,wi25
"I think that the labs and assignments have generally be interesting to work on. Given that I only took COGS18 as my previous experience with python, I think that the labs especially have been a nice refresher and has allowed me to explore some new concepts that I hadn't known about before. Beyond a few hiccups of being lost on what tools are available to me for a few tasks, conceptually I am doing pretty well at understanding everything.",1,wi25
Applying python is more practical setting. Not too familiar with python before this class but it's fun getting the hang of it and actually learning about data science.,1,wi25
"The class feels very interactive and engaging, I especially like how Prof. Ellis integrates the attendance questions with lecture content (ie. using the estimation activity as data to clean and analyze later down the line).",1,wi25
"I have enjoyed learning about Seaborn the most. I feel it very fun to try and come up with interesting plots and visualize the data. Once you can see trends, it makes it easy to find answers to problems that arise.",1,wi25
"I liked learning about how to use different plotting libraries in Python. I had previously only used matplotlib to make plots, so getting additional exposure with seaborn helped me understand how to easily make visualizations like countplots.",1,wi25
I really enjoy how open ended the project can be. It gives me something I can show off on my resume which is great. I also loved the guest lectures. I learned a lot of career advice from watching the spotify guest lecture. ,1,wi25
"the lectures, i feel that they are very engaging and interesting",1,wi25
The assignments/discussions. As a bioengineering major I don’t have much experience with python. The assignments are fun as they allow me to sequentially build my knowledge of python and investigate how to code through actual practice.,1,wi25
I've enjoyed learning about the ways in which data can become biased simply by surrounding environments or just inherently in the way it was collected. ,1,wi25
I enjoy that the curriculum is very comprehensive and covers a broad scope and touches lightly on many different essential topics / skills rather than tunnel visioning on one. ,1,wi25
I really enjoyed the high level overview of data science and the pace of the class. As a data science major this material is familiar to me but I am not getting bored with the content.,1,wi25
The project based style of the course where we are able to collaborate on a project with a team similar to the what would happen in the workforce was my favorite because it's the most applicable.,1,wi25
I enjoyed learning about data science principles and how we should be conducting projects. I find the material to be really useful. ,1,wi25
I like how Professor Ellis teaches; she is great at explaining concepts.,1,wi25
Learning about data science and the way the course is structured.,1,wi25
"I have enjoyed the lectures, they are pretty informative and Professor Ellis is highly knowledgeable and an enthusiastic educator. ",1,wi25
"What I have enjoyed most about COGS108 is how simple the flow of the class structure is. I understand what needs to be completed every week and I am given the resources available to do so, as in the information is in the lecture.",1,wi25
Professors Ellies teaching ,1,wi25
I enjoy working with a group as it makes the whole class feel a bit less overwhelming,1,wi25
the lectures! i feel like they're super interesting and interactive,1,wi25
I most enjoyed the lecture style of Professor Ellis. It made going to lectures more enjoyable.,1,wi25
"I like that everything is explained in the most basic level, just to clear everyones basic root concepts",1,wi25
Professor Ellis is one of the best lecturers,1,wi25
the assignments have been engaging and good to develop my skills,1,wi25
"- lecture topics: I love how they always teach new and interesting things, even when it's not directly useful formulas or coding methods like most other data science classes. I really loved the parts on Fermi estimation, the Simpson paradox, and the asynchronous lecture of choosing to watch a pre-recorded lecture from a guest
- reasonable assignment deadlines and workload",1,wi25
I have enjoyed how the lectures include the students especially when the teacher uses our answers as data to show as an example.,1,wi25
Group project and assignments are the things I enjoyed most. Cause I never taken a class with group projects before. This is a challenge but also an interesting thing for me.,1,wi25
"I have enjoyed learning more about. Python. Also, this is my first time using jupyterlab and it has been my favorite coding platform to use so far!",1,wi25
I've enjoyed the real-life application examples of the class. ,1,wi25
"I like doing the homeworks. I think I just enjoy solving problems in general, and writing codes feel like a fun problem solving activity.",1,wi25
"I appreciate that this class is project-based rather than test-focused. It gives me hands-on experience, especially when working in a group and collaborating on ideas. It highlights the importance of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, showing how discussions and meetings can lead to effective solutions.",1,wi25
The lecture. I really enjoy the way Prof Ellis explains things and her enthusiasm towards it. ,1,wi25
"I enjoy the extra practice we get manipulating dataframes, since it is very applicable to one of the other course I am taking this quarter.",1,wi25
The assignments because they are very detailed and straightforward.,1,wi25
I have enjoyed learning about the scope of data science and the possibilities data analysis can unlock and the variety of questions it can answer,1,wi25
"I enjoyed learning a bit of every thing about data science application like pandas and plt and sns, etc. I also like the overall pace of the course.",1,wi25
I've enjoyed collaborating with my group and generating ideas for our project. ,1,wi25
"I don't fall asleep, that's a good sign! Everything is very well and clearly communicated.",1,wi25
I’ve mostly enjoyed learning how to use pandas to my advantage to visualize and clean data. Even though it was kind of difficult it’s enjoyable.,1,wi25
Engaging lectures and largely intuitive assignments,1,wi25
Getting hands on experience and learning from it.,1,wi25
I really enjoy the fact that we have live code and I can see what each function does and the graphs it outputs.,1,wi25
"I have enjoyed the lectures being interactive. For example, the think-pair-share and questions wider concepts such as the Fermi estimation. ",1,wi25
Being able to apply data science to real-world scenarios. The topics we learned so far were really interesting and I enjoyed working with PANDAS and seaborn.,1,wi25
Learning more about pandas in python,1,wi25
"I really enjoyed how the topic of ethics in data science was covered fairly early in this class. When applying for college, I wanted to study Cognitive Science, mainly because of the many ethical dilemmas involved with the subject, especially in regards to data collection and social media algorithms. The ethics lectures was a great reminder for me of why I wanted to study CogSci at UCSD in the first place. ",1,wi25
"I enjoy how the lectures are really organized and the professor is well spoken, which makes it easy to follow along. Last quarter when I took COGS 18, the professor was a little hard to understand and the lectures would be scrambled, so I really appreciate the lectures that I have now.",1,wi25
I like the parts were Professor Ellis codes directly in JupyterLab and then runs it so I get a direct visual understanding of how the code works and what it does.,1,wi25
I really like the interactive lectures and the assignments also are a comprehensive review of everything that weve learned so far. ,1,wi25
The in-class participation/think pair share activities and the wisdom of the crowds where we get to apply what we are learning and talk through our ideas with our classmates.,1,wi25
"I enjoy going to lecture so far. They are easy to follow, engaging, and interesting to learn.",1,wi25
I like how the slideshows are organized are well on the github.,1,wi25
"Discussion assignments, as they are thorough and easy enough for me to get a grasp of the coding application of what we learned in class throughout the week. It feels more like a hand-holding assignment which prepares me well for the actual assignment",1,wi25
The process of choosing project topics.,1,wi25
I enjoyed the easy structure of what to do and when to do assignments as well as the availability of accessing lectures and notes.,1,wi25
I've enjoyed the lectures and learning about different aspects of data science.,1,wi25
"I enjoy the hand on aspect of this course. The assignments so far are approachable and good learning experiences, and are very relevant to the content you go over during lecture. love how we are doing a collaborative project instead of an exam",1,wi25
"I like the discussions and assignments because it gives me an opportunity to do hands on coding, which is something that is really lacking in my ICAM classes but that I want a lot more experience with. I also like my discussion section because it's a chance for my TA to answer my coding questions (kinda like office hours time which is really helpful)",1,wi25
I've enjoyed working with data visualization in COGS 108. I liked transforming raw data into something that is more meaningful to look at. This allows me to present data that may look difficult to understand into something more visually pleasing.,1,wi25
"Labs and Assignments, which are easy to follow and focus on understanding the fundamentals and the tools to work with data projects.",1,wi25
I have liked the idea of freedom with the group projects. The assignments we do give us great practice with what we need.,1,wi25
I liked the group formation and the early project assignments. This feels like a good way to actually apply the skills we learn to a topic we are interested in; it increases motivation to learn.,1,wi25
The hands on homework and the learn by doing aspect of the class.,1,wi25
It is structured very well. I think the assignments and discussions on datahub are good at teaching practical skills and foundational knowledge. They're not too easy to the point where I don't improve and they're not too hard to the point where I learn nothing because I have no idea what to do. The expectations of the course are well-communicated too.,1,wi25
"I enjoyed the lectures, the way the professor teaches and shows both the pdf slides as well as in jupyter.",1,wi25
"I have enjoyed the lectures the most. I think the lectures are engaging and interesting. For instance, by demonstrating certain data science concepts real-time through the Google Form surveys. Furthermore, the Jupyter notebooks keep things hands on, and there is a good balance between informative slides and practical ones.",1,wi25
I love how we are able to interact more with one another in the class through the project. ,1,wi25
I love how it is encouraged that we engage with the teacher assistants.,1,wi25
I have enjoyed getting to explore the platform of Jupyter Notebook and Github. I have never coded in this format and find it helpful to work with in comparison to my prior experience with PAs.,1,wi25

I've enjoyed refreshing myself with Python and working with my group on our project.,1,wi25
Learning about a whole new field. As a bio/neuroscience major it’s cool to add new tools to my skillset. ,1,wi25
"I've enjoyed the organization of the class. Specifically, I have liked the variety of course work from labs, assignments, lecture notes, GitHub to quizzes. It helps me learn when I have multiple sources of learning rather than just lectures and coding. I like moving between platforms, keeps my mind engaged when I can shift through various tasks.",1,wi25
"I enjoyed the lectures and the way she explains certain concepts with the tone of her voice, it doesn't sound monotone, and makes the content interesting. ",1,wi25
Selecting peers for the group project is comforting. I also enjoyed learning about different graphs and their purposes.,1,wi25
"The discussion assignments, I think they cover a lot and are really helpful",1,wi25
being able to code a program that creates  graph or form of data visualization,1,wi25
Working with data and writing code to analyze the data,1,wi25
"Yes, it has been pretty interesting",1,wi25
"I have enjoyed the lectures and found it very interesting, engaging, and interactive. ",1,wi25
"I really like the engagement, especially with the quizzes that we take during the class (and how it reveals the score, which while it is not for credit, makes them really fun to take!!). I also think that everyone has been really helpful, especially when asking questions over discussion and on EdStem!",1,wi25
"class vibes, feels interactive",1,wi25
"I like applying coding concepts to real-world examples. It feels like I am seeing how it can be used in a career/research, which is exciting!",1,wi25
Looking at different ways of interpretating the data.,1,wi25
I enjoy the assignments and the vast amount of visual representation tools that we are using. They are very useful for the future and toward my current personal/career projects.,1,wi25
"Lectures have been easy to watch as it is hard for me to commute often, but the accessibility to watching lectures online makes it easier for me to be able to keep up with the curriculum",1,wi25
Group Project,1,wi25
"I've most enjoyed learning about how to properly use EDA and pandas data wrangling. This is due to the fact that I want to be in the data science/ML field for my career, and as such, need to know how to properly use data and prepare it for projects I may need in the future. ",1,wi25
I've been enjoying reviewing python and learning more about Pandas compared to COGS 18. I hope we can work with more data sets and get more practice so I don't have to google things as often:),1,wi25
"I've enjoyed all the practice with python, it has felt very useful and important to my learning not just as a data scientist but a 21st century student",1,wi25
I've really enjoyed the pace and attention to detail in the lectures. Its obvious Prof Ellis has a clear understanding of how she wants to go over the course material and it reflects the quiz material and project really well.,1,wi25
"I think the most enjoyable part of COGS 108 so far is the manipulation of the data. While it's quite difficult, I think it's really cool to see how it all works.",1,wi25
"I've enjoyed doing more python. During COGS18, I enjoyed getting to understand python. Though it's more difficult now in this upper division class,  I still enjoy getting to understand and be more knowledgeable about what I could do with python even if it's more based on data science.",1,wi25
I really enjoyed that this course involves group work because it allows for me to step out of my comfort zone a bit.,1,wi25
Graphs,1,wi25
"I've really enjoyed the in class polls, I believe it keeps everyone in lecture really engaged, and it's really interesting to see the data from everyone in the class.",1,wi25
I have liked the assignments and discussion assignments because they are practical and work in the real world ,1,wi25
I like that this class has an organized schedule and presentations. There are times were I have an increasingly hard time understanding concepts when the slides and lecture notes aren't clear or organized but I haven't had that problem in this class. And it's easy to miss assignments when the set schedule keeps changing so i'm glad we're on track in this class.,1,wi25
I like the discussions because of how interactive they are ,1,wi25
Learning about github,1,wi25
I've enjoyed working on coding assignments and learning how to process and analyze data.,1,wi25
"What I have enjoyed the most thus far is learning how to properly display a data set. Whilst I still have a very trivial understanding of what is considered to be a good display vs a bad one, it has been interesting as I personally believe I am a creative individual so having the opportunity to take something like numbers and be able to mold them into different digestible shapes and colors has been a lot of fun.",1,wi25
yes. I enjoy leaning what’s needed in order to make a good analysis of a data set. It is very practical.,1,wi25
"I enjoy all the data exploration we have done so far. I think the data we work with is interesting, fun, and informative",1,wi25
I like my team and how we work and get along with each other,1,wi25
"I enjoyed the discussion labs, they taught me a lot of useful skills in Pandas",1,wi25
"As someone who doesn't know much about data science, I am enjoying learning about how it's real life applications. I'm also enjoying coding on jupyter notebook too -- working on code and have it finally work is a really fun feeling. ",1,wi25
Coding assignments are fun,1,wi25
Doing the coding assignments and learning new Python.,1,wi25
I have enjoyed looking at relevant information and correlating it to the work in class. I haven't done too much stuff regarding data science and coding so I enjoy this!,1,wi25
Get to do Python again,1,wi25
How I get to team with people to work in a project,1,wi25
The assignments. I enjoy working with dataframes in python.,1,wi25
I really enjoyed the Fermi estimation questions. I feel like the engage me the most during lectures,1,wi25
The discussion notebooks take a long time to finish and are a lot of work that doesn't teach much,0,wi25
"I think I have least liked the weekly quizzes, simply because I sometimes forget that they are there to be done. However, I understand the importance of them and I have been more mindful of incorporating the short quiz into my to-do list items. ",0,wi25
"This is just a personal thing, but I have had practically zilch experience with Python (I am, however, not new to programming as a whole. I was taught C++ first, followed by Java. I have my qualms with Python), but I am doing review and watching “python for c++ programmers” videos to get myself up to speed.",0,wi25
I wish that discussion sections were podcasted,0,wi25
"Something that I didn't like as much was the grading for the assignments and discussions. Although there are test cases on the assignments, there are hidden cases that are also in the questions. Since I am trying to fulfill the question and solve for a specific test case, there are issues with the test cases that wouldn't work with the hidden ones. As  a result, I would get docked because I was trying to solve the question, rather than fulfilling the hidden case. This could be an error on my side, but I haven't understood the syntax and functions to their full extent yet, so I would find different functions that also fulfill the question, but fail the hidden tests.",0,wi25
"Nothing much, everything is going smoothly and there are enough support.",0,wi25
I think the project part is a little slow because we haven't done much related to it yet.,0,wi25
I have been a little stressed about the slow pace of getting the project started because I have become more accustomed to a faster paced project-based class (like cogs 137). But even that is okay,0,wi25
I don't have anything I like the least. ,0,wi25
The quizzes feel like an added stress when we have a lab and assignment due.,0,wi25
I wish we had more places to practice and code more,0,wi25
I have no complaints so far. Everything is fine,0,wi25
It feels kind of slow because I already learned most of the material.,0,wi25
Since coding is not my strong suit the labs and assignments can get a little tricky for me sometimes. Being able to run through my code and validate it is very helpful. I don't particularly like the hidden tests but I understand why are they are put in place. ,0,wi25
I wish we could see our quiz answers/scores sooner (I understand how that might not be possible for weeks with free response questions that need to be manually graded).,0,wi25
"As of right now, I cannot think about anything that I liked the least about COGS 108. I find the workload to be do-able and the content interesting.",0,wi25
"I don't enjoy using datahub and ed, it's annoying to use these things for only one class ",0,wi25
"I had very little programming experience before this class, so having to get used to coding again has been very time consuming.",0,wi25
"I don't really like Data Hub. Since it's my first data science class, I'm new to it, and it can get really annoying waiting for cells to run at times, but that's about it.",0,wi25
"I liked the quizzes the least. Compared to the discussions and assignments, I feel that they don’t go as in depth.",0,wi25
"Github...Only because some of the interface is kind of confusing, but since it is important for the final project, I am getting used to usign it. ",0,wi25
"For some discussions, some of the TA/IAs dont give information to help with assignments or labs but rather just sit there dont do anything. But i have gone to some discussions where the TA/IA give a great explainations to help us.",0,wi25
I dislike Jupyter Notebook as it often doesn't run properly and needing to restart the kernal often. This makes doing the assignment and labs difficult because I would code something correctly and it would fail multiple times but nothing is wrong. ,0,wi25
I feel like we jumped into seaborn and mathplot really fast and it has been a little difficult adjusting but otherwise it's going well.,0,wi25
Glitches with Jupyter notebooks functionality,0,wi25
I haven't enjoyed how finnicky assertions can be in some assignments,0,wi25
What I've liked least about the class is the length of the discussion lab assignments. Some of them have taken more time to complete than the assignments themselves. ,0,wi25
I’m only taking this class to fulfill my major requirement so if it wasn’t required I probably wouldn’t take it. ,0,wi25
"I think one thing that annoyed me is the bugginess of JupyterLab. When I try validating my assignments on datahub it always crashes or lags for a long time, which shows how buggy my notebook is. That's the only thing that I really didn't like. ",0,wi25
I don't really like using jupyter hub because of how it runs the code. Sometimes my code would be correct and it would give me an error and when I refresh the page a few times it would work.,0,wi25
I’ve least liked the moments of confusion I feel during lecture when concepts relating to applications to further analyze data; I think i would benefit from a more slow and simplified explanation as a newbie to data science. ,0,wi25
I think I like the group project the least. I feel a little unsure of how it should be approached or how I should work towards the project without holding my group back.,0,wi25
It can get really confusing sometimes. Also we have to use extra time outside of class time for the group project.,0,wi25
"I think when it comes to assignments, I think when it comes to the assignments, it tends to get very laggy or glitchy when running the kernel, I know it's a client-side problem, but it is sometimes frustrating when I try running my notebook.",0,wi25
"Honestly, the class time haha - I know this is completely out of the control of the instructor but it does interfere with some of my other obligations.",0,wi25
"I do not like how uncertain COGS 108 is. For example, the final project. I have no idea of the outcome or how it is to be all done because we learn one thing in class and then it's another thing. We switch from conceptual learning (i.e. clean and tidy data, ethics, and the 9 questions) then we go to actual coding. It has been confusing and overwhelming to say the least.",0,wi25
The thing that I liked least about cogs 108 is doing the labs and assignments because some of them tend to be tedious and have a lot of instructions to read and follow in a very specific manner. I understand how they are good for learning the basics of python but they can tend to be a bit too long in my opinion.,0,wi25
"The assignments and discussions are often very different from what we learn in lecture. I know this was mentioned in class, but it still takes some research to be able to complete them (since I do not have a coding background).",0,wi25
The thing I have enjoyed the least about cogs 108 is honestly probably lecture since I am already familiar with the content that we have been covering for the past five weeks.,0,wi25
THE AMOUNT OF ASSIGNMENTS/TIME COMMITMENT PER WEEK,0,wi25
"I least enjoy working on discussion labs because in lab, we spend more time on group project than focusing on the lab.",0,wi25
I feel like it required a lot more previous knowledge of coding than I thought.,0,wi25
I would like to tell that the guiding part of homework and labs are not clear enough to me.,0,wi25
wish there was more time for simple and small examples to practice using seaborn and matlab before a2/d3,0,wi25
"I think probably my least favorite thing would be the speed at which collab is expected, around week 2 classes are barely getting settled and I do think it would be helpful to do some kind of survey or interest and try to pair people in the first two weeks off that to ensure groups are cohesive. The other thing is just way pandas and those things are taught however I dont think its specific to this class, the library is so expansive it basically always boils down to ""you know the use cases if you need syntax look at the documentation"" but I do recognize that the limiting factor is time. Very minor nit picks though overall am enjoying the class.",0,wi25
"I feel slightly frustrated by the instruction-related errors that occur in the coding assignments. I understand that mistakes happen, but I start to get confused when I have to keep track of the announcements in lecture or EdStem. The issues with A2 were particularly stressful. I also struggle to complete the labs sometimes when there haven't been as many examples in the lectures, but I understand that the purpose is to make us synthesize what we learned to form a concrete solution.",0,wi25
Probably the assignments they are long and sometimes can be a little confusing. ,0,wi25
Navigating working with my group has been a bit awkward because I don't know them very well and find that they may not want to meet in person. This has nothing to do with the class!,0,wi25
The quizes,0,wi25
I do not like the data wrangling assignments because I feel like I do not have that much experience with Python so I feel like I’m struggling with it more.,0,wi25
"Overall I am pretty pleased with the class. I sometimes forget about the weekly quizzes, but that's on me. They're straightforward and relate to the material in a way that makes sense. ",0,wi25
"The thing I liked the least so far is how sometimes the lecture notes doesn't always align well with the lab assignments. However, this is still a fair system because this class isn't meant to be an introductory one. To make this easier I think I'm going to try to find a master list of things to use in python code. ",0,wi25
"The thing I like least so far is that I feel like we are expected to do things in the discussion labs or assignments that I am not familiar with. But, this makes sense because this is not an introductory class and the issues are often fixed with a couple searches on google.",0,wi25
"It takes a while to sit down and do the assignments and having to do a lecture quiz every week. The project also takes time to coordinate a time with group members, which was sometimes hard.",0,wi25
I have liked least figuring out each site we use to submit work and understanding where everything is on each site. I still feel unsure about git but I am getting more comfortable on Jupyter notebook.,0,wi25
I have least liked the structure of the homeworks. ,0,wi25
Lecture is at 9am :(,0,wi25
Wish all lecture material was covered before discussion lab is released so you can go to earlier section weekdays ,0,wi25
Not being able to understand the long lines of coding,0,wi25
I liked leaast about COGS 108 is the hidden tests that doesn't show and fail to get full points on the assignment.,0,wi25
I least enjoy coding especially working with data frames. I personally am not too confident in coding.,0,wi25
"There isn’t anything that I have to complain about but maybe for better group building, it would be nice to have required a group assignment earlier in the quarter to  get comfortable with each other before starting work. ",0,wi25
I don't love the assignments honestly. They're difficult to debug and a lot of times I'll get an error and it'll fix itself after I restart the kernel. Then they'll reappear so I'm not sure if there really is an error or not.,0,wi25
"I love everything that this class has. If I have to pick one, I'd say is the new experiences with different platforms and coding language that I wasn't familiar with, which made me to step out my comfort zone haha. Overall, I appreciate it so much but I don't like it very much",0,wi25
"I don't think this is directly tied to Cogs 108, but sometimes datahub/jupyter notebook doesn't work that well.",0,wi25
"I wish the class slides could be more specific on teaching us to code, though all of us have had basic python class before, the level of learning is quite different between individuals. ",0,wi25
Like what I like most I also don't like that everything is due on the same day because it make it overwhelming that everything that week is all due on one day.,0,wi25
"The quizzes can sometimes have confusing questions that were not really covered in the lecture but rather a continuation of what we covered in the lecture. For example, if in a lecture, we covered a topic from A to E, the quiz would ask about something after E, meaning outside what we covered. That is expected, but sometimes I can argue that multiple answers (or both answers if T/F question) are correct. In that case, I cannot go back to the lecture because we did not cover this.
Also, I think for one of the quizzes, we were asked about something we still had not covered in class yet, as we ran out of time, so we left it for next week, but the quiz still had a question about it. I think that happened in quiz 3, where we were asked about privacy when we had not yet covered it in the lecture.",0,wi25
"The D3 assignment was honestly quite difficult. I had to ask for a lot of help and even when the TA's gave me a glimpse of their code I had no idea what they were doing, what things meant, how I would even begin to try and complete that myself. I think it's because our lectures had nothing to do with data viz so it was mostly figure it out yourself. Also, some of the questions were not worded very clearly so it was not explicit what kind of graph/output the question was asking for.",0,wi25
"I think my least favorite part about COGS 108 so far has been version control, just since it was a new concept for me and I found it a bit confusing/stressful to implement since I was worried I'd mess something up more permanently compared to just messing up a section of code. However, I think Github Desktop has been really helpful in helping me understand this section of lecture.",0,wi25
"I have not liked the non step by step homework, more specifically D4. I got a bit lost, and had somewhat of a hard time doing the coding.",0,wi25
"9am class time, I go to bed too late",0,wi25
"I think the organization of the class is a little overwhelming because there are so much work to remember. Although the workload of each work may not be so heavy, all the workload splits into different tasks make me hard to track them. Sometimes, it is easy to omit some task and lose that point.",0,wi25
"For me, some of the discussion labs are a bit hard due to the depth of python programming those assignments assume I have but don't. ",0,wi25
The course doesn't explain python syntax or support for people less experienced in coding which I understand. ,0,wi25
I don't have any complaints about COGS 108.,0,wi25
The amount of students feels a little overwhelming and makes me feel invisible. But I resolve this by coming to class early and sitting in the front row. ,0,wi25
I guess the lack of depth. We don’t go much into detail about things. But it’s 10 weeks and we wanna cover a lot so it makes sense.,0,wi25
I have not particularly enjoyed some of the assignments because there have been issues with some of the assert tests.,0,wi25
"I have least liked the lectures through slides, I enjoy the lectures that are on datahub much more because it allows us to see live application of what we are learning.",0,wi25
Assignments are a bit stressful just because I want a good grade and they are worth a lot more than the lab assignments.,0,wi25
"I think so far, one of the things I would change is making discussion section more helpful in regards to the assignments, like a brief walk through the D assignments.",0,wi25
Sometimes the datahub assignments can get annoying. The test cases are sort of strict. ,0,wi25
"The first assignment, instructions about the github portion was not well and I missing that part of the grade even with the github repos. ",0,wi25
It's hard to find a time where all 5 people in the group are available to meet.,0,wi25
"The project seems so overwhelming and so much work, despite us not even starting really yet.",0,wi25
The weekly labs are lengthy ,0,wi25
The lecture quizzes because sometimes it is subjective.,0,wi25
I thought the assignments are really long and I procrastinate finishing it. I'd rather have assignments more often but less to do for each one. ,0,wi25
The thing I've enjoyed is that sometimes they are hard topics to grasp.,0,wi25
"There's nothing that comes to my mind, I think everything in the course is designed very well",0,wi25
labs,0,wi25
"Currently, I mostly like everything in this class. However, there was one assignment that I particularly disliked. That assignment was reviewing past COGS 108 final projects. Although I liked the idea and thought behind it, I do not think it was effective in what the assignment wanted to achieve. The questions that we had to answer for the project we reviewed were challenging to answer because I didn't really know how to answer them. I didn't know if the projects were good or bad. I didn't know if the code was good or bad. I didn't know if the visualizations for the machine learning part were good or bad. There was a lot of content within the projects that was unfamiliar, so it was hard to pinpoint what was effective within the project and what wasn't. I kind of had to just go off of the feeling or vibes I got from the project. I think the only thing I found helpful were the introductions and background at the start of those projects because they helped me understand what a project should look like.",0,wi25
"The labs and assignments aren't hard, but there's dues each week which makes me somehow feel stressed when it comes to exam week.",0,wi25
"There is nothing particular that I dislike about COGS 108. Everything is perfectly fine to me so far, but if there is one thing I have to pick, sometimes the professor talks too fast. I sometimes get lost if we speed run through one slide, especially if that topic is new to me.",0,wi25
"I wish we had more review over the coding parts, it's a bit confusing to figure out homework sometimes",0,wi25
"There are too many assignments and it gets confusing to remember. The content isn't hard or time-consuming, but it's just hard to track all the different types of assignments. I would rather have one or maybe two a week that are longer so it is not confusing",0,wi25
"My least favorite part of COGS 108 so far was the difficulty that D3 was, but I'm not blaming anyone for this besides perhaps myself... I didn't go to section. I was trying to do it by myself at home, and the lecture notes had some good examples here and there.",0,wi25
I wish there was a more in-depth tutorial for pandas and the different types of things you can do with it.,0,wi25
I feel like the labs could be a bit more detailed in regards to syntax/what is looked for in the code in the instructions.,0,wi25
"There's not a particular thing that I don't like, but if would be better if the font size of the code could be bigger when projected on the screen because sometimes it's a little hard to see what's being modified on the code.",0,wi25
Probably the D3 lab assignment just because it took me awhile to get it and I spent hours on it trying to figure it out.,0,wi25
Sometimes the discussion assignments feel a little repetitive.,0,wi25
I feel more practical examples would help in better understanding the comcept,0,wi25
Assignment 1,0,wi25
I am not a big fan of group projects and I think especially ones where the project is largely in our hands. It will be an academic challenge that I'm not accustomed to but I also know that the final product will be very rewarding. ,0,wi25
"Bugs with jupyter notebook assignments that make me nervous when submitting. The submission process is quite more complicated compared to other submission processes; for example the assignment must be fetched and manually submitted, and even then are some of the validation does not work at times.",0,wi25
I am a litlle scared about the final project.,0,wi25
Misalignment between lectures and assignments. Which is okay but just causes some confusion sometimes. ,0,wi25
"The group project, but this is solely due to personal preference. I usually choose to work alone when the option is available, this is solely due to personal preference.",0,wi25
Deciding on a data science question and being able to find the ideal dataset seemed like a tiring and tedious process.,0,wi25
"For one week, I did the discussion before the assignment and I felt like the assignment kind of taught you how to do the things for the discussion lab and didn't realize that. ",0,wi25
I have not enjoyed trying to figure out the graphs in the Labs and the autograder,0,wi25
"The thing I liked least about COGS 108 so far is that the weekly quizzes are single attempt. I think it would be more informative if it allowed multiple attempts, while also having some relevant multiple-choice coding questions.",0,wi25
the clearness about the instructions ,0,wi25
The discussion hw and assignments because it's mostly stuff I have done before,0,wi25
"I think that the group project is extremely intimidating. The project task itself seems very extensive in what I would need to do to accomplish it but also having to work on it with 4 other people of which some seem to have a different perspective about the quality of work to strive for, it is a bit stressful just thinking about how my future timeline is going to look.",0,wi25
"What I've liked the least so far is the extra credit. I know it's extra and professors don't need to do it and I'm thankful there is extra credit at all, but the opportunity to do and earn more would be nice.",0,wi25
"Felt like I always have to look up and double check documentation for pandas/seaborn, but maybe all the functions haven't sunk in yet. The lectures going through the notebooks are quick and tend to gloss over a lot of details but overall I think that's fine, I probably just need more practice with pandas.",0,wi25
"The large amounts of work, I feel very overwhelmed. There is a lot of content, some of which I have done, other is new. I feel like the class moves very quickly.",0,wi25
"I thought that the instructions in some of the assignments and discussions have been a little bit unclear, and some of the loading in data cells take a rather long time to load. But, my questions have always been quickly answered in EdStem which I appreciate.",0,wi25
"I have least enjoyed the discussion and assignments. This is because I find a lot of the questions to be ambiguous. I'm often left wondering what the question wants me to do, and I end up having to reverse engineer the solution from the assert statements. In my opinion, I should not have to do this if the question is clear enough in what it wants me to return/do. 
Also, DataHub is very difficult to work with at times, as I've had trouble validating, saving notebooks, and submitting assignments. In my opinion, the assignments should be on GitHub so that students both can use the git clone and git pull commands they learned, while having the files locally to avoid the current conflicts that I face with DataHub.",0,wi25
"the homework, i feel that i struggle a bit with the hw especially the discussion ones and often times get confused on what the error is",0,wi25
The majority of my classes are Tuesday and Thursday and 1 hour 20 minutes. I think having longer lectures would better suit the class as often topics are spanning multiple lectures. In the second day of the topic I often have to catch myself up on what was done last lecture,0,wi25
"I dislike how little guidance there is for some of the coding, especially coming in without any prior python knowledge. It would help a bit more to go over more of the unique syntax and general functions of the code in class more often. ",0,wi25
"The assignments and discussions are very poorly made. There are often typos and spelling errors. On more complex problems, there should be examples on what the input should look like",0,wi25
"Sometimes, the weekly quizzes would ask questions that the professor didn't cover yet and it was in the lecture she gave after she came back from her trip.",0,wi25
"Sometimes, the instructions for the assignments and labs don’t give enough information. For example, for D3, we weren’t told that one of the graphs was supposed to be a grouped barplot instead of a stacked proportion graph like we were taught in lecture. I only figured this out when I went to discussion to ask about a different question.",0,wi25
I don't like how the weekly assignments and labs feel like busy work. There just feels like a lot to do but maybe that is just the quarter system,0,wi25
The datahub glitches.,0,wi25
"I don't enjoy how python heavy the course is, it's definitely a steep learning curve for those that are not too familiar with python so the assignment and discussion lab can be pretty daunting and harsh. ",0,wi25
"What I have liked least about COGS 108 so far is how difficult some times the assignment becomes. What I mean by this is that, sometimes when I am doing an assignment I am stuck on one part for a very long time and un able to correctly match the assertion values. Yes, I do look at online resources to look up syntax, however sometimes I am unable to get the correct values which leads to frustration. I suggest teaching more syntax that is applicable in the assignments and labs.",0,wi25
I'm not used to coding so sometimes the labs and assignments are very challenging especially because it feels like we haven't really learned many parts of it in class. However I've really only taken cogs 18 which was very straight forward in terms of what we learned in class was exactly what was on the labs so I know it supposed to be a bit more challenging in this class,0,wi25
using jupyterhub - i know its super convenient but in my experience it's been really buggy and half the time my environment is messed up and my code won't run :(,0,wi25
I least liked D3 because it personally felt like the most confusing assignment we have had so far.,0,wi25
I think the homeworks are a little too easy... I start them the day it is due and can finish them really quickly... some more challenging ML assignments would be more fun,0,wi25
"Assignments are all due Sunday, a weekday would have been preferable but I'm super happy that they are all due on the same day so I don't have to think about what is due when.",0,wi25
some of the stuff to organize with my group has been tricky but thats mostly canvas,0,wi25
"I just wish that the coding was shown a bit more because as someone who took CSE 11 I know very little about pandas as I started with java. The concepts aren't too hard, but it just feels like I am behind when it comes to coding.",0,wi25
The feedback for assignments and quizzes are a little bit slow. But anything else I feel good with this course.,0,wi25
"The material can get confusing at some points, and if I don't pay attention in class for a little while I feel as if I fall behind pretty quickly.",0,wi25
"I kinda wish the assignments didn't have hidden tests, but I understand why they do. ",0,wi25
"Mostly the in-person lectures, but only because 2pm is not a good time for me and I can't go to the 9am one. So, the lectures when I go in-person haven't really helped me a lot just entirely because I'm mentally gone at around that time. But watching the podcasts are helpful.",0,wi25
"COGS 108 has been one of the most challenging classes I’ve taken since I’m not a professional coder and have only an introductory level of coding experience. My biggest struggle with the course is that, despite putting in my best effort, I often encounter errors in assignments and discussions. When I submit my work (knowing that there are errors) I receive low scores without the opportunity to improve after submission. The grading focuses on correctness rather than completion or learning from mistakes, which I understand, but it can be discouraging. I try to attend office hours for help, but my class and work schedule sometimes make it difficult—though I recognize that this isn't the course’s fault.",0,wi25
Jupyternotebook not being explained well enough. Perhaps it's because I haven't been going to all the discussion sessions. ,0,wi25
Lecture is early in the morning,0,wi25
This is my first upper-division class with coding in it and I have never taken a class in Python. I am not used to learning a lot of the coding on my own but this is something I can get used to. ,0,wi25
It's more a project thing than a cogs108 course thing but finding great datasets for a good question is so hard :'),0,wi25
My least favorite component has been having to write code for graphs. ,0,wi25
"So far so good, the labs are kind of slow but nothing too bad.",0,wi25
"I don’t think there was anything in specific, just definitely took me some time to get accustomed to using pandas but it’s also because I’ve never used it.",0,wi25
"Nitpick- Difficulty of D4, a bit unguided assignments at times",0,wi25
The coding and how tedious it is. ,0,wi25
"I don't have any complaints so far, I have really enjoyed the class!",0,wi25
"I have least liked the lectures that did not correspond to the assignments/discussion labs timing-wise. My prior experience in coding is COGS 18, and so far this has been a big step in coding for me. I am trying my best to understand, but it is harder than I expected.",0,wi25
"The assignments can be somewhat tedious, but the workload is manageable so far. ",0,wi25
"The hardest part of COGS 108 so far has been some of the assignments, that have had either confusing or too-vague instructions, and the TAs have not always been helpful on how to debug my code. In particular, the most recent D4 lab was a little confusing, as there were a few times where I did not understand what the instructions were asking of me. However, the assignments and labs have been very helpful in gaining good practice on coding with Python, Pandas, and Seaborn, and it has been fun to get back into coding when I have not coded for so long.",0,wi25
"What I like least about COGS 108 are the assignments. Some of the assignments would take me hours or days to do compared to the assignments I had in COGS 18. This is not the professors fault, its mainly due to my slow understanding of python and the course's rigor.",0,wi25
The part I like least about this class is pacing. I would like there to be more in-depth coverage of what the code does exactly because sometimes it's confusing and hard to remember right away.,0,wi25
Nothing really I like the pace and content,0,wi25
"Having to look up pandas syntax and functions in order to do what is being asked of me in the weekly lab assignments, since there isn't always a hint or direction about what to use to accomplish a certain task so I have to use trial and error.",0,wi25
The assignments are pretty difficult to do alone. I usually need to collaborate with a friend to complete them on time but it isn't something that I should complain or worry too much about.,0,wi25
I think the least think I like about cogs 18 is how there are so many assignments.,0,wi25
"Nothing in particular in terms of content, maybe I could say that I struggle to fit in with a group when it comes to doing large application projects with a team, though I know this is important for the real-world and is a good aspect of the course, it is more of a personal thing for me ",0,wi25
Labs :(,0,wi25
I'd like to see the concepts we learned in class to still be retaught/referenced again in our assignments rather than just problem sets.,0,wi25
"The difficulty of the discussions lab. I wish tas were more willing to help you through the problems instead of pointing towards some vague lesson in lecture. More often then not, I am present in discussion, because I can't understand the lecture, and I wish discussions aided in answering questions more directly. ",0,wi25
"The actual project part so far has been kind of difficult for me (like writing up the project proposal). I guess I just don't feel prepared, but I might not have as much background in data science as some other people in the class so that could be making it more difficult?",0,wi25
"I found the Jupyter Notebook environment to be unreliable. I thought it was really slow and had frequent kernel issues, like getting stuck during restarts or the validation took not working correctly, so I had to exit out and try again.",0,wi25
I feel like the discussion assignments are very similar to the assignments.,0,wi25
"Some of the syntax for pandas and seaborn is really unintuitive and took me a while to learn, and learning it was unsatisfying in the process. ",0,wi25
I feel like the lectures could include more resources for the coding parts as most of the coding feels like self taught learning for myself at least.,0,wi25
Reviewing graded work. I wish there were example answers on jupyter after grades are released rather than just scores.,0,wi25
"I haven't particularly found the discussions very helpful, I think some of them are like you do your own work there and if you need help, ask. Kind of like office hours- ",0,wi25
"I think the discussions have been a little bit lacking in content. This was based on my experience in the first discussion, because after that I did not really go because I assumed it was just extra office hours like the first discussion.",0,wi25
"It's not too bad, the workload and everything, but one thing would be that we do move at a relatively quick pace especially the pandas lecture and seaborn, but the homework and discussion helps. ",0,wi25
Sometimes going back and forth between discussing technical/practical applications of python and discussing theoretical/conceptual ideas of data science can get confusing and make the flow of the course a little disorienting.,0,wi25
"I think the speed it somewhat difficult, but I know that is just the way of the quarter system. I wish there was more detail on some of the more complex topics, but that would require another class.",0,wi25
"I think pacing wise sometime around week 3/4 we lost track of ours in alignment with our assignments which was made things a little confusing. The guest lectures were for important reasons, I think I mean more when we resumed lecturing with Professor Ellis it took a little to find our footing again.",0,wi25
"I’ve already learned essentially the same material in COGS9. The assignments feel like they were made in a rush, with many typos and poor autograders. I wish the group project started earlier, because now I feel like my group has to cram for the next 5 weeks to get this whole project done. I wish the class focused more on the collaboration, My group has only met once and it’s week 5? We are all busy, so cramming this project in the next couple weeks is going to be difficult. It would be a lot easier if the proposal was due week 3 or something.",0,wi25
"The due dates that are all on sunday, I like if it was due on Friday's. However, I don't really have a struggle with this.",0,wi25
"The most challenging part of COGS 108 has been the steep learning curve for certain tools or datahub probelms, especially when documentation isn't straightforward. It can feel overwhelming at times to balance debugging with meeting project deadlines.",0,wi25
"Probably some of the length of the assignments, I feel like after I complete one part, there's much more to do after.",0,wi25
I have found the heavy workload and challenging coordination in group projects can be demanding. I also personally do not like that assignments and labs are assigned at the same time but I do understand that the course is structured in a certain way. ,0,wi25
I do not like Jupiter Notebooks. It takes way to long to load assignments and the delay is horrible.,0,wi25
I have not enjoyed having both an assignment and discussion lab I feel like in the long run one of them should be reconsidered or combined in one because it feels a little overwhelming to have three assignments or more due every week. ,0,wi25
Trying to get the group project moving when a lot of the members have exams from other classes has been kind of hard.,0,wi25
"I found it a little out of my comfort zone to find a group in a class that I didn't know anybody. I would say it was a good experience though. And similarly, the 9 am lecture is a little early for me, but I also appreciate getting my day started earlier and have been really good about attending lecture and adjusting my schedule. I have had early classes in the past, but haven't been as good about regularly attending.",0,wi25
"My group hasn't been very active on the chat except for one person, so the problem I'd say with COGS 108 is when choosing partners. Overall, it's a great class, but the thing is that when choosing your group, it can be tough to work with people who don't incorporate themselves.",0,wi25
"what I least like about Cogs 108 is sometimes the use of data hub. This is a personal opinion based on my experiences so far but every time I need to run the cells or compile them the website takes forever to load, sometimes not even loading. I would have to refresh multiple times to have the cells run and its quite a hassle.",0,wi25
"I would say discussions and assignments are sometime a little time consuming, but overall nothing I really dislike.",0,wi25
The ambivalent test cases from the last lab that was a time sink for me (I did appreciate that it was addressed and cleared up),0,wi25
The lack of canvas utilization. There're too many links located densely in the home page and it can be frustrating to go through at times.,0,wi25
Coming up with a good project proposal. It's hard to find a topic that doesn't have too large of a scope and it feasible. It's also hard to find public data sets on topics I am interested in such as specific video games content.,0,wi25
"So far, I don't like the portions outside of coding like the analysis and communication parts.",0,wi25
"Sometimes, the assignment question prompts are worded confusingly/not clearly which makes it hard to know exactly what we are supposed to do, not sure if this is just a misunderstanding on my end though. ",0,wi25
"The one person in my group project group who has commandeered the project and completely taken it in a different direction by being pushy and not giving anyone else a chance to think and have a say for themselves, or ask others what they would like to do with the project, or give a democratic vote to the direction we take.",0,wi25
"the group project aspect. i feel that no matter what group youre in, there will be 1 to 2 people in your group that give little to no effort, suck at communicating, etc.",0,wi25
"I like it overall, but it is sometimes hard to understand the content (pandas) because I'm new to those and a transfer/international student. ",0,wi25
"I'm generally fine with how the course is run overall. If I had to pick something I like the least, I guess I would say it is the weekly quizzes we have. It feels a little unnecessary for me since I regularly attend lecture and am committed to actually learning everything.",0,wi25
"I feel like the homework is slightly challenging which is good and the pacing of learning new content is manageable, although sometimes the work load for some weeks can be a lot more than others. This allows me to practice time management to be able to finish everything on time.",0,wi25
"""I don't like the lab work and the assignments because the tests are not really useful. I don't think we really need the lab session with the test, and I don't think the lab should be doing that. I believe we should have the chance to test the code by ourselves, and the test should only serve as a reference.",0,wi25
Lots of assignments that I have to keep track of every week - they all have the same deadline but it feels like more pressure because there’s something due every week. ,0,wi25
I personally haven't enjoyed how much python has been covered but that is because for me I have already done most of this so it's review that isn't super useful yet. I understand though that I am not the majority so I don't see this as an issue it's just what I enjoy the least.,0,wi25
"Learning about Pandas, and other libraries ",0,wi25
"One thing I liked lesat about the class was the group making, I tried making groups and messaging people only to find out that they didn't choose me to be in the group and I had to find out myself through messaging them. Now I'm in a group that I didn't choose and I'm just going with the flow.",0,wi25
"i'm not really into all the python review for the class. it feels like a lot of busy work and not the best use of time in the class, especially considering a lot of other classes go into depth. we're only spending like half of the quarter/class actually working on the class, when it is a project based class? i think it would be better to be able to spend more on the actual project",0,wi25
The pace of the lectures (too slow).,0,wi25
"So far in COGS 108, I have least enjoyed coordinating group meeting times.",0,wi25
Some assignments and labs just because its hard to determine the correct answer since typically coding has to be exact.,0,wi25
Completing assignments that required searching up codes that we haven't learned in lecture was the part I dislike about COGS 108. It always have me questioning if my code is correct or if it is executing what the question asked for even after it passes the assert tests.,0,wi25
"I'm finding the group assignment difficult because my group is very disorganized, but I think we are working on getting more organized now that we are starting to work on the project. ",0,wi25
The assignments are pretty challenging and confusing at times when the notes don’t align.,0,wi25
The past of class lectures feeling a little too slow for me.,0,wi25
I didn't like the Google forms as they sometimes closed too quickly before I could finish my responses.,0,wi25
"For me, it is the assignments and labs because they take a bit of my time to finish. Maybe it is cause I came into this class knowing Java it would be nice to have some guidance/master doc explaining syntax and functions.",0,wi25
"I have enjoyed least debugging grading issues with the assignments. For example, I accidently deleted a cell and that caused me a difficult rabbit hole of trying to debug the issue. Another example is the csv wouldn't load in one cell causing the next cell to not pass an assert and would confuse me trying to validate the assignment. Although this does not happen often and I understand how it is unavoidable but it has been a little difficult. ",0,wi25
I wish that we could do projects with less than 4 people.,0,wi25
I do not particularly like how all the due dates are on Sundays because I feel like that just enables me to procrastinate more.,0,wi25
"Something I have liked the least is having difficulty with labs/assignments when something in them was not covered in class. I understand that we should work to arrive at a certain answer, but I struggle at times as someone with a very basic knowledge of python. ",0,wi25
The fact that two of my group members take so damn long to respond ,0,wi25
The datahub was confusing to use in order to find assignments and how to submit. ,0,wi25
Some of the content that was taught earlier either did not feel too relevant to the class or should not have gone into much depth. Some examples are the Fermi estimations and scientific notation review. ,0,wi25
Using datahub is annoying sometimes,0,wi25
Figuring out GitHub with little demo ,0,wi25
"Jupyter notebook has been difficult to use with GitHub, I had never used it Jupyter before just GitHub so it took a while to figure out how to setup the notebook ",0,wi25
"The class layout, datahub, and github repo are very confusing. As a student, it is easiest when everything is in one place, and I have to go searching for a lot of assignments and things. There are also a lot of things due, but I am glad that they are consistently due at the same time every week so I can have some ease from that.",0,wi25
"The biggest thing I've disliked is actually figuring out a proposal for our project because none of my group members had ideas and we really struggled with even coming up with examples or topics to get our ideas flowing. The directions are also way too vague, and it would've been much better appreciated if some broad genres or some ideas could be given to us to help out as to what we'd have liked to do. ",0,wi25
mmm nothing? it's kinda a cool class,0,wi25
Sometimes I feel like I'm falling behind but I have managed to be caught up so far.,0,wi25
"While I’ve really enjoyed COGS 108 overall, one challenge I’ve faced is that some of the assignments don’t always directly relate to the lecture material. At times, it feels like we are expected to figure things out on our own rather than following a clear step-by-step connection from the lectures.
 I do however understand that this approach is intentional—it pushes us to think critically, problem-solve, and develop independence in working with data, which are essential skills for real-world data science",0,wi25
Assignments -- not really enjoyed the least. The quality of questions can be a bit confusing,0,wi25
When I run into a coding problem or an unfamiliar problem that I have no idea where to start. ,0,wi25
"The morning time of the lecture (9 am is quite early), And the 2pm lecture clashes with another class for me",0,wi25
"Using the jupyter notebook system is somewhat of a pain. Also, as a transfer commuter student (living at home), not having a live zoom option (like we did during the day of the lockdown) is a real pain, as the drive (takes a lot of time) and parking (extremely hard to find) can be extremely difficult and tiring to deal with.",0,wi25
Something I am adamently not liking in this course is the ratio. I wanted more men in this class,0,wi25
"Lab assignments, tedious ",0,wi25
"The thing i enjoyed least is woking on assignment, it could be frustrating sometimes",0,wi25
The attendance ec only being 0.5% makes it seem like it is not as worth it if I had missed already 1-2 classes.,0,wi25
The labs and lectures are a little slow and boring sometimes. I feel like the speed of the lectures could be a little faster. ,0,wi25
The classroom felt a bit too crowded at first.,0,wi25
I would say just not enough time spent on learning GitHub as a class. Exploring the application itself.,0,wi25
I do not get inspiration about my project topic through lectures. I feel like it would be better if there was a lecture regarding data science project explorations. ,0,wi25
Datahub is always broken when it comes to running Discussions and Assignments.,0,wi25
How long the assignments are at times.,0,wi25
How early classes are. Especially in the mornings with the weather I have trouble getting up early enough.,0,wi25
too much data science attendance ,0,wi25
"I think the deadlines are a little bit tight, but I think they are manageable. ",0,wi25
"Github is new to me and confusing… I know many in the class are experienced with it, but since it isn’t a prereq I don’t feel like there’s been enough explanation of the basics at times. I also wish assignment code was more directly related to lecture content. I’d just prefer more support on that end. ",0,wi25
"Maybe the weekly timed review quiz, since it only allows one attempt and has a 15 minutes time limit.",0,wi25
I think the quizzes because it is a little stressful that it is timed 15 minutes and you cant see the score till a lot later.,0,wi25
The group project has been my least favorite part because I prefer working independently. Coordinating schedules and communicating with others to plan and discuss tasks can take a lot of time.,0,wi25
"I think I am enjoying the course so far, it would be helpful if we could have access to all discussion slides and if they could go more over the things expected in assignments/labs.",0,wi25
I wish the lectures and homework material were a bit more interconnected with each other. ,0,wi25
"So far, I haven't encountered anything that stands out as particularly challenging or unenjoyable. The course content and structure have been straightforward, and the assignments are clear, so there's nothing in particular that I would say I dislike.",0,wi25
What I’ve liked least is having to constantly flip through lecture notes to find specific commands or methods. It would be helpful to have a more organized reference sheet or a quick-access guide instead of searching through multiple slides and notebooks.,0,wi25
"I don’t think there is anything is particularly that I have not liked. Maybe a bit more clarity on programming assignments because some so far in PA2, the instructions were quite strange and hard to follow.",0,wi25
"Group work, my team does not seem very proactive",0,wi25
I have no qualms about COGS 108 so far.,0,wi25
"I feel like the timeline for the group project should be more spaced out, for example making the previous project review due earlier and having more checkpoint group assignments.",0,wi25
Assignments are very hard to pass all the tests.,0,wi25
It is difficult for me to complete a group project this quarter. ,0,wi25
I would say the coding. I feel like between lecture content does not really help with coding assignments much,0,wi25
"The parts of class where we discuss things with our neighbors is overwhelming for me. With so many people talking at the same time, it is difficult to have a productive interaction with neighbors and usually leaves me in more of a state of confusion/nervousness than before.",0,wi25
too much assignment,0,wi25
"The assignments have been quite stressful because after losing points on the first assignment, I've been overthinking every hidden test case to ensure that I can get full credit and not lose any points.",0,wi25
I do not have any complaints about COGS 108.,0,wi25
"I don't like the lack of clarity for some discussion assignments in the instructions. I know it would be better to attend the discussion, but in situations where we are unable to, I feel the discussion assignments aren't clear enough to do on your own. ",0,wi25
Datahub :( I would prefer some form of gradescope as most of my other assignments are submitted there. ,0,wi25
I wish classes were more interactive amongst students instead of just following along with the lecture and doing the check in questions.,0,wi25
There aren't any pain points that really stand out to me. ,0,wi25
"My answer is not necessary something I do not like, it is just extra challenging for me: 
The fact that we are doing everything in GitHub and the way most of the thing are being done in the class are so new to me and challenging and sometimes it stresses me out but it is not a bad thing at all and I am excited for the day that I get comfortable with all of these. ",0,wi25
I feel like I haven't been as engaged with the lectures recently. ,0,wi25
"I think that sometimes the Labs are harder than the actual assignments, which can be seen as a good thing because they better prepare us for the Assignments, however, it actually felt like the opposite was true with A2 and D3, it felt like doing A2 first would have made D3 easier.",0,wi25
Jupyter notebooks just dont like it personally,0,wi25
Nothing! This class is great!,0,wi25
"For me personally, the lectures have been really slow, and I feel like there is a sometimes between what we learn in lecture and the skills that we need to implement in the discussion worksheets and assignments. ",0,wi25
"My least favorite thing about COGS 108 is that there are so many assignments (DX assignment, AX assignment, weekly quiz, group submission) that are all due on Sunday. It can be overwhelming at times to make sure I am turning in every assignment on time.",0,wi25
Debugging has been quite difficult and I would like some more guidance.,0,wi25
"Sometimes, assignments (A1, A2) have taken me longer because I get stuck (especially if we haven't covered something in lecture), but eventually I am able to figure it out.",0,wi25
My least favorite part about Cogs 108 is learning github. Github is confusing to learn about but im doing a lot better. I dont really have a least favorite part about this class.,0,wi25
What I liked least is having both assignments and labs due.,0,wi25
"What I like least about COGS 108 so far is probably the assignments because they seem a bit difficult or time consuming at times. However, I understand these assignments are essential to understand and grasp the concepts that we will need to complete our final project.",0,wi25
"I think since my team and I have vastly different interests, trying to come up with a question which is equally engaging for all of us has been a bit of a challenge",0,wi25
Sometimes I feel like asking for definitions of certain vocab words in the quizzes isn't 100% representative of understanding.,0,wi25
Trying to coordinate with team members to work on the project assignments has been a bit difficult. It was hard to get a hold of all the members before the first assignment was due.,0,wi25
I just can't remember stuff from COGS 18 so all my code takes an excruciating amount of trial and error or looking up documentation that I can't remember.,0,wi25
Lots of assignments that I am having a hard time keeping track of. Also I wish we learned more technical commands or had a key/guide of some functions that could help with pandas.,0,wi25
"Sometimes I feel like the assignments are a bit vague in JupyterNotebooks, and I wish there could be more assistance.",0,wi25
Nothing as such I am having a great time in the course. The only negative experience has been a confusion in the team formation for the group project where we had to be reassigned a different team and caused delays in the project timeline.,0,wi25
Some of the labs have been a little too hard or the grading too strict,0,wi25
Datahub can be slow sometimes,0,wi25
not much class participation opportunities. ,0,wi25
re-learning about the graphs etc ,0,wi25
"Would have preferred to do the project solo, but I get wanting to facilitate collaboration due to the reality of working on a team. ",0,wi25
"It was mentioned during one of the lectures that as an upper-division course, this course will introduce us to concepts, but it is up to us to practice those concepts outside of lecture time. This has been something that I have been struggling with--even though I enjoy the pace of the course, I do still find myself getting stuck with how to approach assignments or labs, despite attending discussion sections. I believe a bit of a deeper dive into how to approach assignments/labs (similar to the structure of COGS 18) would help a lot.",0,wi25
I don't really like using data. I have that much.. ,0,wi25
Lab assignments are a bit confusing to understand sometimes.,0,wi25
"What I like the least are the assignments. I think they are a bit too long and so take a lot of time to complete. I think later on in the quarter when the final project deadline nears, I will have to devote more time to it rather than assignments. I don't reject the usefulness of assignments when it comes to refining coding skills but I think it would be better if they were a bit shorter. ",0,wi25
I do not like when my code doesn't work and it takes me hours to figure it out :(,0,wi25
"The one thing I like LEAST about COGS 108 is that despite having a group of (3/4) for the project, individuals still able to be added on.",0,wi25
Something I liked least was having to look up a lot of functions or documentations for the code that we used in assignments. Having to look up different coding documentations make it harder to approach the assignment because it can be overwhelming and get lost. Having hints or something that refers to a documentation that we were supposed to use would make it helpful to know what types of functions are expected.,0,wi25
"I like the labs/discussion assignment the least, only because I struggle the most on the labs. Some of the wording can be confusing, especially when the prompt is sort of vague. For example D4 asks to look at the data we scrapped and look at the age statistics, however I wasn't sure if it meant to look at the previous data frame, or the main data frame.",0,wi25
It would be nice to have a centralized place for all of the functions that we use in this class. It seems like a big chunk of the time spent on labs or assignments is digging through Jupyter notebooks and documentation for a specific function or parameter if we don't remember it off the top of our heads. ,0,wi25
I think it’s hard to keep up with the content sometimes,0,wi25
It is a big class. Hence sometimes students will talk during the lecture and it is a distraction.,0,wi25
The people in the group project are not at all contributing. ,0,wi25
"It feels like to look for course info, sometimes I need to search on datahub, github, and canvas. I think it would be great if there was a centralized place with everything linked that I could reference.",0,wi25
When the code can't run,0,wi25
"Although concepts like data ethics are important, I would enjoy learning more practical applications of data analysis over theoretical frameworks and guidelines.",0,wi25
"Sometimes the google forms stress me out when I dont submit in time, its too quick of time and im a slow typer",0,wi25
When the class tends to feel boring and the energy is not there.,0,wi25
"There is certainly a steep learning curve for people who have not had much coding or data science experience so maybe a bit more direction in this realm, however I do think jumping straight into a difficult project is a phenomenal way to learn though it may be very time consuming.",0,wi25
quizzes - needlessly stressful,0,wi25
"I think that the lectures are a bit slow paced. I understand that this is meant to be more of an introduction class, but since I have experience in the software engineering industry, it felt a bit slow.",0,wi25
"While I like the fact that lecture time is split between general strategies for data science research and some specific note taking via Jupiter notebooks, I feel as if there’s not enough of it in the lectures. While I understand there needs to be some sort of discovery and research element to the discussions and assignments, I think going over more specifics (coding) for the assignments would help a lot :)",0,wi25
It would be great if we moved a little faster. ,0,wi25
"I did not like that the quizzes are timed for 15 minutes, where they could be helpful from the perspective of learning for the students if they were not timed.",0,wi25
"I'm actually not a huge fan of how everything is due on one day, although I admit it's up to me to not procrastinate, I think it would be easier to organize my time and mentally separate assignments from labs if they were due on separate days. ",0,wi25
"I don't have anything in particular that I dislike. If I had to choose, it would be the group project. I wasn't aware the group project would take a big portion of this class, and I came in not knowing anyone in this class. I had to choose a random group to join, so I think it is a bit harder for me to take lead and contribute more ideas to my group. ",0,wi25
"Assignments, having a little hard time with it but I understand if I spend lots of time on it.",0,wi25
"There isn't anything that stands out that I've liked least about this course up to this point. If I had to pick something, it would be that finding the current lecture material isn't too intuitive. I often get mixed up about which PDF or Jupyter Noteboook is being used in lecture. ",0,wi25
the labs/assignments,0,wi25
"The questions in the discussion coding assignments (d4 in particular) have been worded pretty badly, meaning its hard to understand what they're asking for. There's a difference between asking a question and make the coder really THINK of how to manipulate their dataframe to get what they want, versus implying that you want the coder to do something, but are ambiguous about it. For example, one of the questions in d4 asks about retrieving a subset of the age dataframe of elements that overlap with the politics dataset. But then, in the question before it, it asks 'what if we got all the years of 1950s till now?'  When I read this problem, I thought that you were asking us to do two different things: retrieve all the data from both dataframes from 1950s to now, and then, merge two dataframes based on overlapping attributes. I hope you understand what I'm saying. 

Please, also, grammar check the questions you're trying to ask in the coding assignments. Reading badly worded questions and also seeing grammar mistakes makes the credibility and trustworthiness I have in the academic team in cogs 108 so much lower.",0,wi25
"Frankly, there is nothing that I liked least about the COGS 108 course itself. But if I had to pick one, I would say the class period. 9:00 AM is too early for me, and I cannot attend the lectures at 2:00 PM due to a conflict with another class.",0,wi25
"I have liked the aspect of assignments having thorough instructions and less descriptive instructions for discussions the least. It causes me to attempt assignments first and discussions, which are supposed to be the ""easier"" between the two, afterwards. ",0,wi25
Having to schedule times to meet up for the project since I live off campus and if we want to meet in person I usually have to go out of my way to go to campus.,0,wi25
the amount of coidng ,0,wi25
Issues with datahub,0,wi25
I don't really have any issues with the course other than maybe sometimes we can go over things quite fast in lecture but this is easily solved by reviewing the podcasts. ,0,wi25
"The one thing I've liked least about COGS 108 so far is the inability to connect with my group well. I'm trying to jog conversation and get the ball rolling for the project deliverables, but it's become quite hard to gather ideas and worse yet, conclude and agree on a singular idea. I hope to be able to improve this as time continues.",0,wi25
"Although I said the coding has been fun, it's also daunting and overwhelming. I'm definitely scared for the final project, as my teammates and I are going to have to take the knowledge we've learnt through the assignments and apply them to actual data sets. However, the concepts itself presented in COGS 108 haven't been too difficult.",0,wi25
I sometimes find the assignments to be a little obtuse and difficult to figure out.,0,wi25
Some of the assignments are difficult for someone who doesn't have a lot of experience w python,0,wi25
"The github stuff, because they are a little bit annoying",0,wi25
"Sometimes the discussion and assignment tasks are not as clear, which causes rereads and multiple trial and error before understanding.",0,wi25
Something that I have liked the least in COGS 108 (but I understand that they are made that way to specifically help us get more practice) is the length of the assignments. I think they can be quite long and time-consuming.,0,wi25
"Nothing, I feel like the class is fair and rigorous.",0,wi25
"One thing I liked least about COGS 108 was the lab assignments. Some instructions felt vague and ambiguous, which sometimes led me to misinterpret them. There were a few times when I completed a task differently than intended, only to realize the mistake after double-checking with the TA.",0,wi25
Discussion assignments can be a little hard,0,wi25
"I do not like how some of the assignments and discussion work have confusing questions that could not simply be answered by looking at the notes. Obviously, we have to think outside the box to solve these problems but some of the data visualization problems have been really tricky and I had to find help online since the tests were also strict.",0,wi25
Feeling hard for me who are not cognitive science major.,0,wi25
"It has been difficult to connect with my team mates so far, since collaboration with them has been completely asynchronous. This makes it difficult to plan and move forward with the main project.",0,wi25
"Lots of deadlines, but there is a lot of course content so I understand",0,wi25
Homework is due on Sundays. Especially the quizzes that only come out on Friday afternoon. I don't want to be doing schoolwork during my weekends.,0,wi25
I enjoy how this class is set up and taught; n/a.,0,wi25
I think I dislike the final project because it’s something that involves multiple people and scheduling is very difficult for us.,0,wi25
The one thing I like least about COGS108 the instructions are some of the coding work can be ambiguous.,0,wi25
I liked everything in COGS 108 so far,0,wi25
The assignments as they can get confusing at times.,0,wi25
"Sometimes, the assignments doesn't quite match up the lecture.",0,wi25
labs,0,wi25
I don't like how I can't redeem what I got wrong. I believe having a redemption system where I'm able to correct what I did wrong and incentivize getting points for that would be nice and beneficial to all.,0,wi25
Practical applications. Sometimes I feel like some aspects of lecture aren't applicable or isn't clear regarding labs or assignments.,0,wi25
"While I liked getting put into a group to meet new people, the fear of letting them down because I am in a group is what I like the least.",0,wi25
"The attendance being done through QR code, my back camera does not work, and it makes it hard for me to do the attendance! ",0,wi25
Don’t have any major concerns but I don’t like that all assignments are due weekly on the same day. ,0,wi25
"For me, I’m a data science major in my fourth year and the topics feel very repetitive. I don’t feel like I’m learning anything new. ",0,wi25
I have least liked the discussion assignments.,0,wi25
Maybe that there are few things due each week but I already get to used to the pace for this class.,0,wi25
Things are speeding up in regards to  the final project and the labs have become more difficult and longers.,0,wi25
None on the top of my head; it is a great class,0,wi25
The lecture slides not being uploaded to Canvas because it is harder to access them with  my phone through Datahub and Github,0,wi25
What I have liked the least are the lab sections. I feel like lab sections could be more helpful if we go more over the material we will see in the assignment rather than just letting us figure it out by ourselves.,0,wi25
there isnt anything I dislike about the course so far.,0,wi25
Maybe I would like the lectures to be a little more engaging ,0,wi25
"I have least enjoyed doing the A assignments since they tend to take forever kinda, and they're are little harder. ",0,wi25
Also debugging :),0,wi25
The early class,0,wi25
Having to find random teammates because I only knew 2 other people in the class. I wish it was 3-5 people instead!,0,wi25
We didn't really go into seaborn ,0,wi25
"I didn't really like the pushing and pulling stuff for github because I was really lost, especially since I didn't have a macbook like my TA.",0,wi25
The assignments have been a little tricky and stressful since I am unsure of what the output is supposed to be.,0,wi25
The pace of the class is pretty fast for me given I have only taken Cogs 18 in the past. I think my other team members who are CS majors take this class and it is super easy for them.,0,wi25
"I don’t really like how fast we move, since it’s a lot of new content very fast.",0,wi25
"Sometimes the assisngment instructions can be a little unclear. For instance, the matplot assignment it was kind of confusing to understand what you wanted and we had to look at the test cases. ",0,wi25
The assignments can have some issues from the client side. Maybe a move away from jupyterhub to other options. ,0,wi25
I think the talk with your neighbor works in some classes but this class should avoid it ,0,wi25
"Sometimes debugging and figuring out what went wrong we my code can be a bit frustrating, but it's really satisfying after figuring out what the error was.",0,wi25
"Most of it is review from COGS 9, so there's not much for me to learn about regarding foundations of data science, so this feels more like a continuation of the course and actually applying what we learnt from the course itself.",0,wi25
nothing really everything was explained and I didn't have much questions.,0,wi25
"I think I least disliked how the jupyter notebook was not as user friendly to beginners to help them guide them through coding, cause my other friend is having a lot of trouble, but I'm doing fine due to my experience with coding.",0,wi25
I feel like some lectures do not help me with how to solve the homework.,0,wi25
"I don’t like how I’m often disconnected from Jupyter notebooks, or have issues with data hub such as problems with validation that aren’t due to my code.",0,wi25
The thing I have least liked about Cogs 108 is how sometimes there are weird bugs in the assignments after submitting but it hasn't been a big issue so far since the professor and TA's have helped resolve them.,0,wi25
I don’t think there was anything Indisliked about the class so far. All the work is fair and manageable. ,0,wi25
Some of the TAs in section aren't very helpful so I don't think it's worth it to go unless my group members want to meet during that time. There are a few sections I attended though were the TA is very insightful and helps out a lot!,0,wi25
Datahub. It feels very barebones. There's no intellisense and it's hard to verify what I submitted.,0,wi25
The assignments feel very tedious and require us to do more than what I feel might be necessary. This is mainly because I have learned these topics before so it feels repetitive. Though I can see how for someone that hasn't done this before the content on the assignments can be good practice.  ,0,wi25
"Communicating with team mates, not I don't like it, it's just pretty hard",0,wi25
"As of right now I don't really dislike anything about COGS 108, its living up to the expectations that I have for it !",0,wi25
"I am not too comfortable with the amount of independence the assignments require (separate from the lecture, it feels like I have to self-teach myself some data science methods) but this is not that large of a problem. ",0,wi25
"Plot Graphs. Truthfully, I don't actually mind this, but I need an answer. Although, doing plot graphs and organizing them to have all data visible was a tad bit annoying as I had to do my own research to understand how to better represent data.",0,wi25
Very basic since I'm a data science minor,0,wi25
"I wish attendence was calculated after lectures, because it's hard to remember when or how many days I skipped. Additionally, it's more convinent to have a hard coded statistic rather than conjecture.",0,wi25
One thing that I liked least about COGS 108 so far is how frustrating it can be when the code doesn't work for the assignments. I understand that it's part of the process of learning the material in class but I think this is the one thing that I liked the least.,0,wi25
"Honestly not a whole lot, I like most things about this class. ",0,wi25
i haven't really disliked anything in particular. ,0,wi25
"I would say the DataHub is not always helpful sometimes, it gets stuck. ",0,wi25
I don't really have an issues honestly. It has been an interesting class,0,wi25
I feel like the class is too easy - coming from a physics and data science major.... i feel like im not learning much,0,wi25
"I am not sure if there is anything that I haven't liked least, but I think there is a bit more pressure sometimes to not miss a class because of our participation points despite it maybe being an inconvenience that week. However, this is something that is workable and not a problem as long as I am able to attend either the morning or afternoon class more so than I'd like to miss. ",0,wi25
"Nothing, it's been an enjoyable class! Though, I'm starting to dislike Pandas as a library but that is separate from this class. ",0,wi25
I wish assignment asserts were more clear on checking if your correct. Since I lost a bit of points for some very minor errors that I think the asserts should have been there to tell me rather than be a hidden assert.,0,wi25
Pandas debugging is frustrating because I'm not familiar with Python.,0,wi25
"I feel like some of the assignments and labs don't really align well with the lecture materials. While this is somewhat of a part of the structure of the class, I feel like when working on labs and assignments I have to go back to many different lecture slides and notebooks to understand what to do.

The in-class lack of participation from others.,0,wi25
"I wished there was a calendar on CANVAS to show due dates and what we are going to learn in class. I also wish there was a video that taught us how to use github (for example, showing us how to download github desktop and how you can use this to clone, pull, and push repos). I was a little lost on how to edit the project proposal until I went on Edstem and saw a post regarding this.",0,wi25
I hope the length of the assignments can be a little shorter.,0,wi25
I've had some issues with communication in my group project that will hopefully improve with time. ,0,wi25
"To be honest, I don't like group work very much. I think the students in this course come from different majors, so they pay different attention to this course and have different levels of commitment",0,wi25
"I feel like it is kind of difficult/annoying in a way to work with packages all the time which I totally understand its the foundation of the class and important for us to practice. However, they are finicky and I run into a lot of issues on labs and assignments with them.",0,wi25
"Nothing in particular, things have been pretty smooth!",0,wi25

"So far there is nothing I don’t like. Just sometimes I have trouble navigating where things are, given we have Canvas, GitHub, and Datahub, but I usually figure it out pretty quickly.",0,wi25
"Using datahub. I keep running into problems with it, like pulling lecture notes (which keeps saying error undefined and doesn't give me any error messages to know what's wrong).",0,wi25
I wish we got more time to fill out the in class google forms,0,wi25
Banging my head on my keyboard trying to figure out why my code isnt working,0,wi25
I wished we had more lectures where you coded with us so we could practice coding while in lecture. Doing the code has always helped me learn so I think it would be a good segment to add. ,0,wi25
I feel like the lectures could go into more detail. ,0,wi25
"I have not liked the length of the assignments and parts of D4 due to some of the instructions being more vague than usual, making it harder.",0,wi25
Some of the instructions for the lab and assignments were bit confusing and hard to understand what was being expected.,0,wi25
"I haven't liked the assignments as they have poorly written instructions and I find myself often wondering what I am really being asked to produce or code. In D4, the question, ""Now, take a look at how party breaks down - in other words, calculate how many individuals are in each party in the politics dataset. Store this in party_counts"" is quite confusing because I took this and said ""okay they want it in a dataframe"" so I wrote the code for that only for it not to pass the assert tests because you guys wanted a dictionary. Isn't a dataframe easier to store the information and use later on in the assignment than a dictionary? I just feel like there's a lot of times where you guys can write the instructions to be more specific, and specify what the output should look like.",0,wi25
I pretty enjoyed everything.,0,wi25
Coding isn’t necessarily my favorite thing so sometimes I can get a bit frustrated when I don’t get it right multiple times in a row. But it’s a growth opportunity nonetheless!,0,wi25
Nothing. I like all how this class organized,0,wi25
I dont like how datahub is structured because it can be confusing sometimes. Like sometimes the kernal would crash or the page becomes unresponsive or the validation would just give an error and not be able to validate.,0,wi25
"As described by my friends previously, I thought this course would be more of an introduction to applying data science skills however the grading scheme along with material being covered seems to go beyond that criteria making me feel very overwhelmed and not confident with this course. ",0,wi25
I feel like a lof of the work is repetitive.,0,wi25
"I think the thing that I least enjoyed was also what i enjoyed, it was a bit of a curve navigating through GitHub at first.",0,wi25
When I am getting bugs on assignment coding questions and I cannot figure them out.,0,wi25
"There have not really been any aspects of the class that I have found uninteresting; though, if I had to give an answer, it would be the in-person lab sessions (I just prefer to do the labs at home). However, I do appreciate the fact that you can ask illuminating questions, if you are stumped by a specific part of a lab assignment.",0,wi25
"The labs, I went a couple times and they weren’t very helpful, as a commuter it takes less time to just google stuff up. ",0,wi25
so far everything is interesting ,0,wi25
Number of problems on each Assignment. For many of these we do the same data wrangling task over and over again,0,wi25
"Learning how to use Pandas, numpy and seaborn has been kind of confusing. Even though we're given instructions and notes I still fins myself looking up instructions online. ",0,wi25
the quizzes and reading.,0,wi25
the deadlines for the project ,0,wi25
"I think one assignment per week should be enough. Because if it is more than one assignment per week, a lot of things was not cover in class which makes it very difficult to practice. And if on the homework there is an example question with answer above each questions, it will be very helpful.",0,wi25
"The names of the assignments, wish it were more clear",0,wi25
I have not enjoyed the group project so far because it has been difficult trying to find a time to meet with our entire group. It's also really hard when you are in a group with randomly assigned people.,0,wi25
Some parts I did find repetitive because I am familiar with some topics.,0,wi25
The pace of the class is a bit slow for me cause I already know a lot of the programming concepts being taught but it is understandable since it might not be the same for everyone,0,wi25
I did not like having assignments due every single week. It feel like there was no breathing room.,0,wi25
Github,0,wi25
"This might sound weird, but the slowed pace is at the beginning. I know I will have to work 2x maybe 3x more in the week than I usually do for COGS 108 because of the project-based class, but the beginning makes me not work as hard for it and then when the project portion comes, I feel unprepared. I don't think this is the class' fault at all; it's just how I work with COGS 108.",0,wi25
I don't have anything that I have least liked about this course so far. Everything has been going well and I am enjoying learning about analyzing data through specific coding. ,0,wi25
Nothing. If I had to answer then it will be how early lectures are. ,0,wi25
I'm not the best at coding and because coding is very tedious is isn't fun at times when you think something is right but it's actually not. ,0,wi25
There is no zoom meeting option.,0,wi25
"not really have a problem with it. maybe the group part, hard to communicate with group member in a large course.",0,wi25
the lack of explanation over the coding parts of the class,0,wi25
So far I can't think of any major criticisms with the class.,0,wi25
"been pretty good so far, no complaints :) ",0,wi25
"I would have liked having more time to work with GitHub before using it for the project, like maybe having a GitHub component on some of the assignments, similar to the first assignment, just so I am more familiar with it. Also, if I run into errors, hopefully they would be earlier and in lower stakes assignments",0,wi25
"Having to find project ideas, was hard to single one out",0,wi25
How challenging the assignments are they almost feel impossible ,0,wi25
I did not like that we did the ethics and data visualization lecture content in halves instead of a smooth continuation of the content but i understand that it was the best arrangement possible for that week's circumstance. ,0,wi25
"Likely due to my limited and not so wide-ranging knowledge of pandas, but man are the discussion assignments tough.",0,wi25
"I dislike the assignments, they feel super drawn out and definitely unnecessarily so. ",0,wi25
Some of the assignments felt quite lengthly. I think it could be shortened while still reinforce the concepts we need to learn,0,wi25
I think the quizzes are annoying to do because they are so subjective.,0,wi25
"I think some discussion lab assignments have been pretty difficult (especially number 3) and it required a lot of reading up on documentation to understand how to properly pass each test. However, other than that nothing has been unpleasant.",0,wi25
"So far, there’s nothing I’m dissatisfied with, but having more resources for basic practice coding exercises would make it even better.",0,wi25
Sometimes the assignments can feel pretty difficult but I understand that working through them furthers my understandings on data science.,0,wi25
"The discussion sessions are not the most helpful. They aren't cohesive and usually don't share slides/ what the discussion was about.
Additionally, I understand the main focus being the group project, however, it is just a little difficult when you do not know many people in the class, hence resulting in a group created through Ed where most people do not contribute/ maintain the enthusiasm they first displayed online. (this is not a criticism of the course directly, since i'm sure there are many groups so they each have good/ bad experiences)",0,wi25
A lot of work,0,wi25
I think the instructions on the labs and assignments sometimes are a bit confusing as of what we are asked to do. ,0,wi25
"I feel like it would be more helpful if the discussions were more collaborative. For example, if they showed examples that are similar to the problems we are working on in the discussion assignments on the projector.",0,wi25
"I find Ed to be a little frustrating to use for course communication. Especially since when trying to check if your question has already been answered through the topic filters, most of the posts are not labeled correctly. I end up having to populate all the posts and filter through them manually.",0,wi25
"Labs sometimes have too much work, it should have the minimum required to know the material for the assignment, or maybe help in the project, not be an assignment itself.",0,wi25
the group project work and how it is not possible to do during class and makes the class' lecture and class work feel more disconnected ,0,wi25
"Some of the assert tests for discussion assignments have been extreme and unclear, makes  the assignments a little more tedious and hard than they should be.",0,wi25
I think it would be the discussion questions. ,0,wi25
I have least liked trying to learn github. I have found the platform difficult and just confusing overall to use,0,wi25
This not a dislike but overall maybe too broad so spend little time in each time. I feel like we go from a topic to another very quickly which is reasonable due to nature of the course and time constraints we have. ,0,wi25
"I wish we could go over how github works more in detail especially because we are all at different levels, and sometimes I feel like I am a burden for my group since they know a lot more than I do.",0,wi25

"In one of the labs, one of the instructions was unclear and I spent way too long trying to understand what it is the lab wanted me to do.",0,wi25
"It's not what I like least about the course per se but what I like least about data science/programming/computer work in general: that it is time consuming, tedious, and I sit for long periods of time in front of a screen which is perhaps my least favorite thing to do in life. I just don't like staring at screens (it's one of the reasons why I don't use/like social media). ",0,wi25
"For me, I think the sections have felt kind of useless for me.",0,wi25
 The assignments because they are time consuming,0,wi25
"I found the concepts easier to digest, but hard to execute them and do coding on python. ",0,wi25
The fact that this is a group project based class means having to reach out to other classmates. It’s difficult trying to adjust to how other people like to do things and have to spend time to come up either with some middle ground or just go with what the majority says. It’s anxiety inducing sometimes.,0,wi25
Quizzes seem a little unnecessary. ,0,wi25
Weekly Discussion and Assignments having lot of overlapping parts,0,wi25

the quizzes. dont like them at all,0,wi25
One thing I like the least about COGS 108 is the assignments being due on Sunday night. I think if they were due on Friday it would be more helpful so we don't end up working on most of it during the weekend.,0,wi25
"The discussion sections, went to one and didn't feel a need to go again.",0,wi25
"My least favorite thing about COGS 108 so far is the layout of the class information. Sometimes, it feels like things are hard to find and I think having a website over a github repository would help with that.",0,wi25
Some of the assignments I feel unprepared even after class. ,0,wi25
The pace is fast and a lot of self study need to be done for people not familiar with python,0,wi25
"The thing I've like least about COGS 108 so far is that sometimes it feels like the tutorial on how to use github/jupyterhub is confusing. However, I know that I can figure it out by asking peers or TAs.",0,wi25
"I don't have many dislikes in the class but to be nitpicky, I would have to say that I dislike the discussion assignments as they tend to have some vague instructions at times where I end up lost. ",0,wi25

I have liked least the group project so far because I prefer individual working. ,0,wi25
"Lab assignments are sometimes lengthy for the amount of points they are worth, but not such a big deal as they are doable.",0,wi25
"The assignments, I guess. They're hardly 'unlikable', but compared to the other materials, I generally dislike any form of assignment with hidden tests or such. If I did something wrong, I'd prefer if I get some form of feedback.",0,wi25
"the python assignments. they're honestly okay, but it can be a bit hard to parse through everything because it's all just text. maybe some more visual space would help make things more digestible!",0,wi25

"I wish the due dates were a bit more spread out. For instance, having all programming assignments, discussion assignments, and other project-related tasks due on Sunday can feel a bit overwhelming. However, I do appreciate that we’re given late days if needed.",0,wi25
I struggle with the coding assignments,0,wi25
"So far, the thing that I have liked least about COGS 108 are the discussion labs. While they do somewhat help for the assignments, I feel that the connection is not as clear or intuitive as it should be.",0,wi25
Honestly the quizzes are annoying.,0,wi25
I wish the lecture slides would be divided into days instead of per week so that it would be easier to keep track of the content.,0,wi25
"I haven't liked the repetitive nature of the discussion assignments sometimes, and would wish they were more concise.",0,wi25
"I think maybe there could be a better way to choose groups when it comes to the final project due for this class. I think I got lucky with my group but I was honestly a little stressed at first since I didn't really know anyone coming into this class and wasn't sure if using Ed was going to be helpful in me actually finding a group. I know it's a really big class so the way we did it was probably the best way, but maybe there are alternatives in helping distribute people in groups based on potential topics of interest. ",0,wi25
I would like if we went over a bit more of the coding aspect in class.,0,wi25
"I have least liked doing the assignments as I feel I cannot find the right guidance and resources to do them. During discussion, most people are confused, and peers are also confused when I ask questions outside of class.",0,wi25
I missed about a week of instruction because I was sick and I still feel like I'm having to run to catch up with material so that I understand assignments when they are due.,0,wi25
:),0,wi25
"I think having multiple assignments due on the same day makes it slightly hard as other classes I am taking at the same time do the same, giving me many assignments due on a single day. ",0,wi25
"I have liked the lecture portion of COGS 108 the least. I feel that although it is engaging and interesting, I find it a little difficult to learn enough from them and often have to research a lot on my own.",0,wi25
"I think it has been difficult for me to be working in a larger group and getting to know them. Making sure we are up to date with everything that we have to do has been kind of difficult, but it is not something that I would say that I dislike, it's just something I am not used to.",0,wi25
Weekly quizzes but I just forgot them often.,0,wi25
"Personally, what I least liked so far was doing D3 since it felt like the difficulty just jumped compared to the two discussions before it.",0,wi25
I have not liked the 9am class time. I could not sign up for the later time and I do find that my focus is not as good that early in the morning.,0,wi25
"Nothing, all good :)",0,wi25
I think each week there is many assignments that we have to finish so the class takes up some time to do. But I would agree we are able to better understand the material. ,0,wi25
"There has been a bit of a learning curve with using Seaborn, so I would say that's what I've liked the least.",0,wi25
I don't particular enjoy the lecture quiz since I don't really gain much from it.,0,wi25
"Some of the assignments have been a little bit difficult at times, it can be annoying to run into a problem that you don't know how to solve. But I can't really say that there is anything I've strongly disliked so far in this class, I've mostly enjoyed and been content with the work load and the content in this class. I guess GitHub was a little bit tricky to figure out and feels a little bit tougher to do, but it is interesting and undoubtably useful. ",0,wi25
The assignments are difficult and very time-consuming. ,0,wi25
"the number of deadline, we really need to stay on top of all the work.",0,wi25
"I haven't really liked the slow pace of the class. For example, we're more than half way through the quarter and haven't written any code for the project.",0,wi25
"The assignments are manageable but it is very heavy in terms of content. A lot of the content is very much words and text, and as a visual learner, I would like to see more things like that. ",0,wi25
The challenges faced when trying to understand Github. I still struggle with committing the changes in the proper format to not disturb the flow of the work. ,0,wi25
"I don't really like the coding aspect of this class, as I myself don't really like coding. Even with coming from a python class, it's still hard to navigate and learn all this seaborn and pandas material.",0,wi25
I have not enjoyed review too much since I have taken DSC10 and a lot of the topics are review from both courses.,0,wi25
"I think some of the assignment's writeup are not super clear, therefore I have to spend some time on reading them and make sure I did the right thing through the working process.",0,wi25
"So far, what I have liked least about COGS 108 is the weekly quizzes with a single, timed attempt. While I understand the goal of reinforcing lecture material, the 15-minute limit can feel a bit rushed, especially when trying to carefully read and think through each question. Given that the quizzes are open-notes, I think a slightly longer time frame would allow for a better balance between testing knowledge and reducing unnecessary pressure.

Additionally, the group project structure, while valuable, can be challenging when it comes to coordinating with teammates. Since everyone has different schedules and work styles, ensuring equal participation and meeting deadlines requires extra effort. It would be helpful to have more structured check-ins or built-in mechanisms to address team dynamics early on.",0,wi25
"I dislike having unclear instructions in the notebooks, which confuse me on what each cell should contain. For example, in D4 there was a part where you have to make a year column for the politics Dataframe and put that code in the cell. The markdown text before that cell also says to make a plot with the x-axis being changed to 'year' instead of 'congress' and to categorize the lines on the graph by party. I interpreted this information as having to put the code for adding the year column and the code to plot a graph showing the age over time with different parties in the same cell. This lead to my confusion when there was another coding cell with text that tells me to change the x-axis from 'congress' to 'year'; and another cell that told me to show age over time by party. It left me questioning what code to I put in each cell.",0,wi25
"Too many things to keep track of, also datahub is hard to sort through once there are many assignments.",0,wi25
Datahub freezing or stuttering is the worst part. I have to constantly kill the kernel and rerun everything which is not frequent in my local environment.,0,wi25
"Repeat info of what I've learned before, but that's just a personal thing. Good to review knowledge, though.",0,wi25
"Everything is due on Sunday, and sunday is my recovery day",0,wi25
I wish the class has an online option without missing out on attendance.,0,wi25
"This is more of a personal issue, but I've learned a lot of Python material similar to the things we've been doing in COGS 108 in previous courses, so most assignments are more like refreshers to me than learning new content.",0,wi25
"I think the most challenge is that the workload and pace of the course are a bit fast, and sometimes I need to spend some time writing and debug.",0,wi25
There is nothing that I have actively disliked so far,0,wi25
"Jupyter notebook is kinda weird, but that's probably because I never used it before",0,wi25
The workload can be stressful sometimes.,0,wi25
"I think that overall, the course has been great as it is, and I think that it might be useful to incorporate more live coding and tips for working in pandas in class, as it can sometimes get a little confusing about with the different functions and how to effectively use them.",0,wi25
I have least liked some of the datahub questions as some of them had some weird errors that were hard to debug.,0,wi25
The labs. They're a bit tedious.,0,wi25
"I think i liked the quizs the least, however they play a very small role in the my grade overall. It feels like more of a hassle more than anything, however I can see the purpose behind it.",0,wi25
Inactive group members,0,wi25
"So far, I least liked having to go to class at 9am, which is why I often skip class and just look at the podcast. I know this is my fault and not the course, but this is the only thing I can think of :).",0,wi25
"I feel that there isn't much time in the lecture speaking about the projects and what is expected from us in detail. I understand that it is to allow students to be creative and have free reigns, but for those who are newer to data science, it is a bit overwhelming. Sometimes, I do not know which data science methods to use, especially.  ",0,wi25
Workload can be a bit much from time to time. Weekly assignments can be quite overwhelming. ,0,wi25
"I have liked least about the amount homework due each week. For some of the weeks, an assignment, a lab, and a quiz is due on same week, which is a lot of loading for computational homework for a week (especially for a person not familiar with Github and coding).",0,wi25
I dislike coding a lot,0,wi25
How we dive right into python and it's been pretty hard to do the assignments.,0,wi25
"setting up, we had GitHub lectures for over a week which I think was a waste of time",0,wi25
"I don't like how non-beginner friendly COGS 108 is in regards to GitHub. I think the lectures did help a bit, but for the initial assignment, I had to search up tutorials on how to do a lot of things. I also was very unaware of most of the vocabulary and how to set up ""git bash"", so I had to do my own research.",0,wi25
"Probably the fact that I have to get used to the Python syntax, because it feels frustrating to have to learn to speak a language even when I know what I want to do conceptually. ",0,wi25
"The discussions do not feel very productive. Though it's only really 10 minutes of the TA talking, it still feels like there could be more than just what was discussed in the previous lectures",0,wi25
"Nothing so far,  the class has been really fun. Prof Ellis teaches really well and her in class quizzes are cool.",0,wi25
Some of discussion/assignments being too harsh in the assert or not clear in the question has been annoying.,0,wi25
"The problem descriptions on some assignments can be vague at times. For example, I found myself initially lost as to how the graphs were meant to look on the data visualization assignment, and it took a bit of guesswork to infer whether my plotted graph matched expectations based on the problem description",0,wi25
The assignments have been a little difficult.,0,wi25
Team work has been a bit stressful - it is hard to gather everyone.,0,wi25
The ability to skip lecture. Lecture should be mandatory.,0,wi25
jupyter notebook file sometimes get corrupted ,0,wi25
"The quizzes can be stressful at times because of the short time limit, but it overall isn't too bad. ",0,wi25
I don't like how the assignments and discussion work is on a separate portal. It's just a personal preference on how I am use to coding.,0,wi25
I least liked going to lecture because my lectures are the early ones.,0,wi25
"Some of the questions on the weekly quizzes have seemed either vague, or I don't believe they were emphasized/covered in class enough to warrant being on the quizzes. ",0,wi25
One of the things that has been frustrating was adapting to the trial and error of coding. The endless errors can be a struggle but once a code works it’s really nice and satisfying since it is your own code.,0,wi25
Hard to attend every lecture,0,wi25
"Jupyter is cool and interesting, but it is sometimes laggy and hard to use.",0,wi25
I am not a big fan of coding so just some general unhappiness with how much we have code. ,0,wi25
I’m still getting used to github so that learning curve has been the most difficult ,0,wi25
Discussion 3 was surprisingly difficult.,0,wi25
Probably the difficulty. For me it’s like a blurred language I’m trying to learn. It’s cool to learn but gets frustrating along the way ,0,wi25
Having a couple of unmotivated students in my group has made the project a tad more labor intensive than I'd prefer. Hoping that will change as expectations are communicated.,0,wi25
I have liked the least is how general the projects are without going to office hours. Maybe including a video outline x y and z and what a highly graded project would look like. ,0,wi25
I feel like the final project concepts and process could be emphasized more during lecture. A more week to week guide would be appreciated.,0,wi25
"assignment length sometimes, but this really isn't an issue",0,wi25
navigating github can be a bit tricky,0,wi25
feels a little unstructured/not enough guidance on some homework assignments,0,wi25
"The coding, only because it can be pretty complicated at times.",0,wi25
The group project can be a bit challenging for me because I am still new to Github/coding and found it challenging to work and communicate with my team at some points. ,0,wi25
"My least favorite aspect is how we have some weeks where we have a bunch of assignments all due on the same day, usually a mixture of a lab, assignment, quiz, or something project related. This can sometimes get overwhelming, especially when we need to make sure that we have turned everything due that day. But I think it can be manageable if we do the work earlier, especially on assignments as they get released for a good amount of time before needing to turn them in. I also think slip days help with the amount! ",0,wi25
myself because i struggle whhen i fall behind,0,wi25
"Because my coding background is just COGS18, I feel kind of lost in my understanding of proper syntax/pandas concepts. I have a good grasp of python fundamentals, but troubleshooting is really difficult when concepts are applied to the labs/assignments.",0,wi25
Coding,0,wi25
"As much as I like the assignments, with all the different aspects of the course it can seem a little daunting at times. Perhaps making the Discussion assignments optional would help, however they don't make the course too too difficult. ",0,wi25
i think everything is working fine atm. ,0,wi25
Some lectures felt unnecessary,0,wi25
"I've probably least liked the section of the course on python review. I know it was necessary for students who may have needed it, but felt boring when I've already done python programming for awhile. ",0,wi25
"The part I liked the least so far was how quickly we went through seaborn. I would like more practice with that, since we just had the one discussion lab where it was pretty intense and then the assignment was some matplotlib. I feel like I will be able to figure it out for the group project, but I wish we could have spent more time on it.",0,wi25
"I've not liked that this class is a group project, I've had a lot of bad experiences with group projects that have made me generally not like them.",0,wi25
I wish we'd go over the project a little more. The structure of learning new information and keeping up with the assignments and the project can be a little overwhelming for just one class.,0,wi25
I think the part I've liked least is how much prior knowledge we need for this class. It's not super clear and my group and I are having a hard time figuring a lot of things out. It would be nice to know when something is new information and when something is expected prior knowledge so we know when we should already know something or not. Otherwise we just feel a bit crazy not knowing how something works.,0,wi25
"Although GitHub is a huge part of this class, I don't enjoy it as much. I think that it's quite difficult to understand even the basic parts of it. I don't really understand it as much, even if I tried to watch a few videos on it, which makes it more difficult to do.",0,wi25
I would say what I would like least is the time management with this course as it is rigorous and can be difficult to manage the hard deadlines.,0,wi25
How hard its getting,0,wi25
"It has been difficult to complete all the homework for one night, being Sunday at 11:59pm. Especially now that group work is beginning to be due.",0,wi25
Fixing the code and not knowing what the problem is ,0,wi25
Assignment instructions. Sometime the instructions make it harder to complete the assignments because of its unclear wording.,0,wi25
Probably the assignments only because I tend to struggle more on them. ,0,wi25
learning to use github,0,wi25
Using GitHub has been a struggle for me and complicated.,0,wi25
"Definitely the coding. I know that it's a predominant part of the class, but holy moly, can it be tedious at times. I still struggle to understand what it is I am doing with a lot of aspects of the coding portion of the class, but I'm trying my best to keep up.",0,wi25
Sometimes the in-class quiz for extra credit closed too soon. It just closed after I make my decision after a hesitation.,0,wi25
I hate how scared and anxious I am about the data science project. I wish there was more encouragement and communication with TAs this late into the quarter. I still don't know which TA is my grader.,0,wi25
doing assignments (they take so long :( ),0,wi25
"Although I understand that the goal of the class is to execute a project that I can put on my resume, show off to employers, etc., but I like the group project aspect the least. Group projects are stressful for me because everyone has different goals in classes. I also have run into lots of problems with github/ using the Terminal on my computer, so that has also been a source of stress for me. ",0,wi25
Some of the assignments have buggy parts to them,0,wi25
Getting confused when I don't know how to solve something for the coding assignments and spending time to figure it out.,0,wi25
"I think it was stressful finding a group and coordinating meeting times, but as we get further into the quarter it has gotten better. ",0,wi25
a few of lab assignments were repetitive,0,wi25
Project. I am not a fan of writing descriptions.,0,wi25
Probably the fact the too many assignments are due on the same date. I think that they should be spread out.,0,wi25
