I would also have liked to possibly expanded more on missing data and how to deal with that. The third assignment deals with Beautiful Soup and web scraping a bit, but I feel like it wasn't covered as much as it should have. Overall, part of the compromise of teaching such a breadth of material limits the depth we go into, but I still feel like some areas should be covered more (pandas, numpy, efficency, etc.) ",0,sp19

It's too independent; taking only one python introductory class and having actual projects given my whole group feels lost. A2 took me a week while some CS students took 5 minutes to complete. I had to google 90% of the codes A2 was asking for. It was just to complete at one point and submit. Working in a group made me realize some people know more about coding while others don't have experience at all and that leaves the workload on mostly the ones who know coding the most or have the most leadership skills. ,0,sp19

All of them seem pointless to attend due to the lack of help you can receive in them. The procedure at these discussions is everyone simply sitting down, and the TA/IA waits until an individual has a question on their assignment. I think this is great in terms of office hours, but as an entire section seems to be pointless. Especially for those who are generally confused with the course. There is no form of recap or discussion occurring in these sections. ",0,sp19
I most i dont like about cogs 108 so far is not having the option of choosing own teammate.

"If we can get more instructions and information about the final project during discussion sessions/outside of class, such as a project lab session might help a lot on pushing the group project to be done with the right direction. Sometimes it may easily get lost since it's a first data science project for some of the students, and we cannot do it very efficiently by spending time exploring everything ourselves.",0,wi20
I get points deducted on homework even when the answers make sense,0,wi20
Meeting up with project group can be a struggle since the group has many people.,0,wi20
"I feel like the lectures could be more concise(in terms of number of words said and spacing between words, not in terms of time) (Hemingway's Iceberg Theory). 

To give a specific example from today's lecture(2/18/20), on the podcast from 9:35-10:12, the slide involves the linear regression from our last lecture. I feel like there's not much to say about our linear equation, and a simply structured sentence about how last time we fit our data to a line would suffice to cover this concept.",0,wi20
Quizzes taking place of attendance,0,wi20
Principles that needs to remember,0,wi20
"I don't like the ambiguity of the assignments. They covers a large portion of the grade, which requires a prefect score to get a good final grade and costly to even miss a single question. For example in A3 there's a question asking about ""By looking at the plot you just generated, approximately how many people in df do the data suggest took no steps?"" The figure shows about 1000 people in the bin near 0, however, by a closer look, the data is actually -1, which often indicates missing data. There's a contradiction between instruction and question.",0,wi20

I do not like the weekly quizzes.,0,wi20
"8am lectures, but can't really change anything about that. The fact that to regrade request an assignment, we have to submit a public post to everyone in the class, asking for specific points back, instead of a possible built in regrade button inside the assignments tab under jupyterhub.",0,wi20
"Seems to include a lot of important topics in data science, but only goes very briefly in every single one of them.

"The coding aspect, because any little mistake can be time costly and misread easily haha.",0,wi20
I do not like how strictly the assignments were graded,0,wi20

The homework grading system.,0,wi20
I feel like this class is a repeat of a lot of my other classes so sometimes it is easy to lose interest during lecture.,0,wi20
"Although the assignments are not difficult, there's too few tolerance for faults. A small mistake can cause a significant deduction in the overall grade, and causes a lot of stress on the student. I prefer more difficult assignments with lenient grading that tests the student's knowledge of the course materials rather than whether the student is careful or not. Also, the assignment should focus more on data analysis as a data scientist, and less on some minor details of pandas and python. It would be much less stressful for the student when they know that their grade was deducted because they did not master the material than if it's because they were not careful enough when doing the homework.",0,wi20

The lectures now are already somewhat more engaging so I think the issue is just that people come into the class with completely different experience levels, and it's just unfortunate that everyone has to go through the introduction to get to the more interesting content.",0,wi20

Data Science,1,sp20
I've enjoyed the video lectures the most. I find them very informative and punctual at the same time.,1,sp20
I really enjoy the topics we've learned and I like using Jupyter notebook because it's convenient being able to run code together with the notes. ,1,sp20
Ive liked the homework assignments and how they build on what we learned from lectures. Theyre also not too time consuming which is nice.,1,sp20
"Honestly, it's the fact the there are no tests, the times between when assignments are due are nice and long, which cause no stress and we can do them at our leisure, making sure we really understand the concepts! ",1,sp20
I have enjoyed the format through which the lectures have been provided. The videos that we are responsible for watching are so well-made that I might have ended up watching them even if I was not taking COGS 108 currently.,1,sp20
Working on Assignments ,1,sp20
I like the concept and the Notebook assignments because I have never used pandas before so it is good for me to practice,1,sp20
the assignments have been a great opportunity to get hands-on experience with data science,1,sp20
The assignments are very well-designed and fun to complete.,1,sp20

I have enjoyed the video lectures and sections the most. They have been helpful to me.,1,sp20
"I've really enjoyed learning how to use datahub and work with jupyter notebooks. The material feels very relevant to real life, and is genuinely interesting. I also like how the videos are all broken up into segments instead of having one big fifty minute video, because this is way better for my attention span. ",1,sp20
Learning about different packages that I can use inside of Python.,1,sp20
"I've enjoyed how practical the course is so far. I know we haven't gotten to far into the more advanced materials, but I like how were working more with data rather than theory so it feels like I'm actually doing something.",1,sp20
I enjoyed learning about the applications of data science and actually learning about techniques. ,1,sp20
"I have enjoyed seeing how data can be analyzed using Python, and how it comes together when an adequate research question is asked. ",1,sp20

I really enjoy the assignments and what we have learned in the class.,1,sp20
"The lecture videos are great in helping me understand basic data science concepts, and the projects help to put my understanding to practice.",1,sp20

Learning Python. Its been nice to finally have a reason to learn the language ,1,sp20
I have enjoyed learning how to manipulate data and using pandas.,1,sp20
The project proposal was really interesting to write. We spent a lot of time thinking of what we wanted to do and gathering data and prior works was really fun.,1,sp20
"I like the style of the lecture. Each videos are short so it encourages students to learn rather than falling asleep in a 50mins long lecture video. I also like the structure of the hws, they guide students step by step and also encourage students to research more as well",1,sp20
Learning about data science,1,sp20
I learned a lot about panda and analyzing data,1,sp20
How straight forward the lectures and assignments are,1,sp20

I enjoy how straight forward assignments are. ,1,sp20
"Lectures, lectures are really cleared and well-explained. ",1,sp20

"Playing with data, statistics tool",1,sp20
Not too bad,1,sp20
The professor and her humor on piazza. Shes very understanding and always willing to help when I am stuck on something.,1,sp20
I have enjoyed lecture the most so far. The professor makes everything very easy to understand with the concept explanations and then the examples in the python notebooks.,1,sp20
Understandable lectures and flexible schedule. I can spend the first half of the week learning material then spend the rest of the week doing the homework.,1,sp20
I like learning about creating more effective and clean sets of data; I think tidy data is important and it helps create meaningful visuals.,1,sp20
organized course content - everything is easy to access and find. Feels like the professor is competent with Canvas/github/remote learning,1,sp20
The lecture notebooks are really helpful,1,sp20
Learning about data frames. I have been using the older method of opening a csv and parsing it line by line.,1,sp20
"I have enjoyed the course material the most. We have been working our way through the scientific method, from question to data to analysis, which I think is pretty cool.",1,sp20
the concept is meaningful,1,sp20
This is the best asynchronous class I am taking this quarter. I enjoy the small lecture + quiz format. It makes it easy to keep on pace with the course.,1,sp20
"The teaching method, this can really help me understand a lot things",1,sp20
Ive been enjoying the way lectures are posted on YouTube in a chunk of smaller videos instead of one long 50 minute video. ,1,sp20
Programming assignments are interesting,1,sp20
explain the overview of data analysis process,1,sp20
There are a lot of resources available to students. I appreciate Prof. Ellis's flexibility and understanding. She is very helpful during office hours. The course material is interesting and very useful for industry. ,1,sp20

Most of all I have enjoyed the topics and the approach this class takes to teaching the topics. The videos are straightforward and get to the point which is nice. ,1,sp20
The wide variety of knowledge and application in python,1,sp20
"I've enjoyed learning more in depth about the data science process through our course material. It's interesting learning about the gist of what data scientists do from a guest lecturer for an hour, but I've found that it's even more interesting to learn about the different pieces of the puzzle/method progressively in an interactive way. I have a larger appreciation for what data scientists do even more so now. ",1,sp20
I really enjoy the lectures video and how its broken down into separate videos; I am able to understand the concepts more easily and can refer back to the videos.,1,sp20
the flexibility of accessing lectures,1,sp20
"What I've enjoyed the most was being able to learn about new data models, and specifically how approach data based off what type of analysis you want to perform. I think it is very useful know the specifics for each and how to really approach data sets.",1,sp20
The lecture videos were very concise and clear. I also like that each video is short to keep the audience's attention.,1,sp20

I liked how I could move at my own pace.,1,sp20
"I have enjoyed many things, learning python, a new environment(datahub/notebooks) learning introductory steps of data science and how to manipulate that data with python. 

But what I have enjoyed most is learning in general this course does a great job of balancing rigor, work, and comprehension time. All the slides are also very appealing to the eye and therefore easier to digest and comprehend. I really enjoy this course.      ",1,sp20
The group project,1,sp20
The assignments have been the most enjoyable and where I actually feel I put to practice what I learn.,1,sp20
I really enjoy all of the data visualization,1,sp20

"the example, like what we can do with the real dataset",1,sp20
"The ease of the course, it helps lower my stress",1,sp20
I've enjoyed the structured videos they are very well done and I like how it is organized. I love that we are actually doing data science as a way to learn about it.,1,sp20
the recorded video,1,sp20
"I really enjoyed how statistics and programming is combined in this course. It starts off very simple and explains both sides. I took a CSE class similar to this course and the professor just assumed you knew how to program and basic statistics terms. There was no datahub so I had to figure out Jupyter Notebooks and python on my own. If I had taken this course before that class, I think I would have enjoyed it more. ",1,sp20
I enjoy interactive learning through Jupyter notebook examples and assignments,1,sp20
The Assignments thus far,1,sp20
How it is broken down simplistically so I can learn efficiently as I am a slow learner and lack a lot of background knowledge that I was scared would hinder me in this class,1,sp20
"I think I've enjoyed the group project the most. I think it was really fun getting to talk to a group of classmates and throw around ideas for a research project. Getting to know what others were interested in and how we might approach answering a question with data analysis was really nice, especially just getting to talk to people again like you would during discussion sections or lecture. ",1,sp20
The way the content is taught is extremely interesting! I like how the videos are split up,1,sp20
I've enjoyed the programming assignments because they help me remember how to use Python,1,sp20
the flexibility that we have with watching lectures,1,sp20

"I have experience learning pandas and I can say that I have enjoyed how you have framed this as well as numpy. I also like how you incorporated git. As a DSC major, no one has really explained the processes under the hood in github and I can say that I was really happy to have learned more about it.",1,sp20
I don't personally care too much about the topics being taught in COGS 108 however what I was really impressed with is how much effort the TAs/Tutors and especially the professor is putting in. I recall on one of the past surveys asking for an open answered response I just put in something semi random but I received an email response back that specifically responded to what I had said. I was really surprised because I think that was the first time I ever received a personalized response to one of the hundreds of surveys I've had to fill out. Seeing you all work hard to respond to all the students showed that you really care about your students makes me want to work hard as well! Also the errors in editing you have sometimes are really funny as well.,1,sp20
I'e enjoyed the interactive notebook for lectures as well as being able to work ahead if i need/ move at my own pace. ,1,sp20

learning visualization and data analysis methods,1,sp20
The idea of working with data (such as A2 assignment),1,sp20
"I love how the class is 1/2 programming and 1/2 subject content. It keeps thing new and engaging. If we only learned code, I know I would be overwhelmed very quickly. If we learned only subject content I know I would feel bored. The mix of both makes me engaged. I also feel if the two weren't mixed in the way they are now, I wouldn't be able to make the same connections with code and content",1,sp20
The data analysis that we covered and what it means in relation to the final project,1,sp20
Understanding data science,1,sp20
I enjoyed attempting to think from the perspective of a data scientist in formulating a project approach.,1,sp20
ummm seeing many different graphs,1,sp20

The assignments. The lectures are informative but you only understand the applications when you do the assignemnts. ,1,sp20
Writing code. There is immediate feedback and feels like I am learning something useful.,1,sp20
"I've been enjoying the topics covered in the discussion section, which is more focused on the programming aspect of Python. Although as of right now most of the topics are stuff like data structures or concepts that I already have a grasp on, it's really improving my understanding on these things. As a math major, it's a very common occurrence for me to be able to do something programmatically, but not actually understand why it works.

It's also nice that the a lot of the examples on the video lectures are real case studies. It makes it easier to grasp a concept. Some of the stuff like ethics on data science are also things I've never learned before, so it was really interesting for me.",1,sp20
I enjoy the assignments the most because it is practical training.,1,sp20
Learning about how to format data,1,sp20
Group project is very interesting and our group picked a topic we all had a lot of interest in which makes it even better doing the actual project,1,sp20

Yes. The instructions are incredibly clear and concise and the personal feedback is appreciated.,1,sp20
"Lectures are easily accessible so I can pause when I need to, or go back and watch an explanation over and over again until I understand it!",1,sp20
"I've really enjoyed understanding and learning the different ways that data is actually used and parsed. Previously I had a blackbox mental model of how it ""big data"" worked, but I think this class is helping me ground it into how it actually happens.",1,sp20
videos are very informative ,1,sp20
"So far, it's been all the new concepts from data science that is pretty interesting as well as the overall flow of the class.",1,sp20

"Too early to say, but conceptually, the content. I haven't dealt with much that we have learned practically as I have not started on A2, but I am excited based on the topics we have discussed in lecture. ",1,sp20
"Learning about the different ways to visualize data has been really interesting. The presentation of data is something that I didn't think too much about before this class, so it was really interesting to learn the different ways data can be visualized. Things like how a data table is organized and how charts differ from one another put data and statistics into context. ",1,sp20
"I think the Professor is really good at presenting complex topics in an easy to understand, and less daunting manner.",1,sp20
"I like the coding part, cuz using code to solve problems is very cool.",1,sp20
I like that the videos are split by topic bc it makes the content more digestable. also the quick quizzes at the end are a good grasp check.,1,sp20
the material told in class,1,sp20
"The fact that quizzes are always Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. It forces a small regularity to my schedule. For example, one of my other classes has weekly quizzes, and I procrastinate until the day that quiz is due to catch up on an entire week's of material. Another one of my classes only has 3 grades: a midterm, another midterm, and a final. Yep, that's it. I only started studying for the first midterm the day of the midterm.",1,sp20
data,1,sp20

online classes. I don't have to wake up at 8 am in the morning!,1,sp20
Able to concretely learn things about data science that I had only loosely learned before.,1,sp20
I enjoyed learning about the different concepts associated with data science and how they are relevant in different real world examples. Learning about git was also very useful information.,1,sp20
The professor's assumption that with some terms/ideas we might not be familiar with yet. This has elevated some pressure off the students for sure! I also think that splitting the lectures into parts to focus on specific topics has been important for me to sort and locate that information when necessary.,1,sp20

"I don't like the clarity of grading. I feel like the quizzes often have some questions that ask about something that's really nuanced & I understand that the questions can't all be easy, but I don't think those question topics get enough attention in the video to give us the opportunity to have deeper thought about them. I also wish there was a way to turn in the assignments and see the grade on them before they're due (without necessarily seeing the correct answer) so we can get a better idea of how they're going.",0,sp20

I only took cogs 18, so I am only really familiar with Jupyter notebooks; Github is very confusing and I don't really know how to do code on my local computer outside of jupyter.

So if you forgot on a day where theres not a lot of points, its fine, but if you forget on a day with a lot of points you could be using almost all your 20 free points on one day. I know its ideal that you dont forget but it would make more sense if the quizzes were worth the same points every day. I wish there was the ability to take the quizzes up to a day late for a little bit of credit. Its hard adjusting to online learning and Im not used to remembering to have to take a quiz every other day. Its different being in my home environment as opposed to being at school where I wouldnt forget to go to lecture.

"Definitely the quizzes. I don't have a big problem with having quizzes themselves but at times it feels like its just a bunch of busy work with no leniency on deadlines. I understand that you open up the quizzes the weekend before but a lot of the time I have another class that has priority for an assignment that's due Sun night, Mon night, etc. I believing something like having an extra day for the quizzes would help out a lot at times (Mon quizzes due Tue night, Wed due Thurs night, etc) as it would let me work on whatever I have to finish at the time and not have the COGS quiz in the back of my mind haunting me. One other thing for me personally is just having a little bit more time on some of the quizzes. I've always been a bit of a slow test taker and regarding these quizzes where sometimes the answer is one small thing mentioned in a 20 minute video I find myself going back and forward making sure I have the right answer and it eats up a lot of time for other questions. Adding something like 15 - 30 seconds on each question for the quizzes would help out a lot for me personally.",0,sp20
The deadlines for lecture quizzes being that day. It would be helpful (at least given the current circumstances) if maybe they were all due friday.,0,sp20

"I don't like how I can't see other people besides my project team. I feel like I probably would have made friends in this class if there were actual in-person lectures to go to. I think this is most frustrating since I'm not very familiar with using git/Github. I know that there are tutorials online, but it's almost always easier to have someone to help in real-time. I'm very nervous about using it, still.",0,sp20
The material. I am extremely bad at python and data science and I have honestly no idea what I'm doing in this class. I have such little coding experience (of which none is in python) so for me I'm really struggling in this class. I'm not sure what would help me or make this class easier. At this point it might be easier to change my grading option to P/NP. Please send help.,0,sp20
The course is set up well and I have no real complaints. Attendance is not required and quizzes/assignments are fair.,0,sp20
quiz with time limit,0,sp20
The fact that it is offered online (through no fault of the professor). I learn better in an actual classroom because there is less distractions.,0,sp20
"Nothing that I hate, but I would like a small increase in time for the quizzes. I know they're meant to test our knowledge but a minute or two more would help me not feel so rushed.",0,sp20
How tricky the quizzes are since there's no way to know what to pay attention to ,0,sp20
I think the quiz timer is a bit too short. I didn't have time to think about my answer,0,sp20
It feels like we glance over a lot of the material without applying it in another context than the example in the lecture. I think this concern has been augmented by the fact that we're not about to enter into discussions during a collective lecture. I suppose when I finish the second assignment I will have a more clear idea about how we are being tested for understanding of the materials.,0,sp20
PA's assessment isnt clear ,0,sp20
"To be honest not much. If we're going to pick egg shells here I was a bit confused as to where to find the assignments at first, but that took like 5 mins to figure out via common sense so not much of a problem. ",0,sp20
No live classes or make it feel like something I am working on,0,sp20

MWF quizzes,0,sp20
No complaints in particular.,0,sp20
The short video is kinda dun because the professor broke it into several part and the way she explains it is very clear,0,sp20
"honestly this class is pretty good, i like everything about it. i guess the only thing i don't like is the fact that its online. I feel like having the experience in class, and getting the chance to interact with other students and the instructor in person would make this class even better than it already is.",0,sp20
Writing reports. It is tedious and mind-numbingly boring.,0,sp20
"-) A few of the github links seem to be broken or missing , like the ones for the individual project proposals. The template in the ipynb file was for the group project instead, and I had to go to a specific file path in order to find the correct template. 

-) I'm the type of person that likes to do assignments on one sitting and be done with it, so the video quizzes has been a bit of a hassle for me. I get that I can just finish the video assignments at the beginning of the week but it's a different kind of studying than doing the programming assignments, which is what I'm used to, if that makes sense. With the videos I really have to focus on them for ~10 minutes at a time, do the quiz, and then focus on another thing on the next video. It's also harder for me because I have ADD.

I totally understand that this is due to the sudden change of the course structure though, and I appreciate that these accommodations are made. This is just me being nitpicky lol.",0,sp20
"Even though I like the assignments, I dislike using Python and Pandas. I do not like dynamically typed languages. The Pandas documentation is overly verbose, and I find the design nonsensical and overly complicated. ",0,sp20
The quizzes are too tricky sometimes,0,sp20
"Nothing really, maybe the quiz due at end of every MWF but it's good to keep me on track lol",0,sp20
"The lack of leniency on the video quiz. I understand that the professor is generous enough to give 20 free quiz points, and students really do appreciate it. But I also hope that the professor and TAs know that us students can make a lot of mistakes, especially when it comes to managing our time. Some of us can get carried away with projects and work in other classes that we forget to take the video quizzes. Instead of restricting the quiz right away after the deadline, maybe implement a late penalty for them. This is just a suggestion, I am not in any ways trying to tell the professor and TAs how to do their job. However, I do hope you guys can take this input into account. ",0,sp20
"Perhaps some of the quiz questions aren't as clear as I'd like. Some questions seem ambiguous in the way they're asked, and I can't tell if they want it answered very technically or just generally how we learned it.",0,sp20
"I think there are too many quizzes and I'm not a fan of the fact that only 30 points are ""free"" considered there are 50+ quizzes. ",0,sp20

"Cogs 108 is my favorite class that I have taken at UCSD so far so there isn't a lot of negatives to say but if I had to choose, I did not like how rush",0,sp20
"My least liked part of this class was probably setting up git and github. I recognize how useful these tools are, but I found the setup and initial use very non-intuitive. The git terminal in particular is not the most straightforward, and learning the basics felt tougher than it should have been. Github was also a bit complicated my first time using it, but as I've used it more it makes more sense.",0,sp20

"A lot of it is expected to be on your own, which is difficult with my workload. ",0,sp20
"Honestly, I don't enjoy the quizzes because even when I take the quizzes immediately after watching the lecture, I still get points off. The shorter quizzes sometimes don't have enough time either.",0,sp20
"I think the part I like least so far is group projects because they are very communication orientated and at points I feel like not contributing. It's because I haven't been normalized into group project settings yet. But in another light, I see this as an opportunity to be less afraid of working with other people and to learn to voice ideas to others!",0,sp20
"Sometimes I do struggle with components of the assignments (for example, wondering what Q3D is asking for, etc.), but I can't tell if it's because it's genuinely challenging or if my programming skills require additional brushing-up. I'm sure it's the latter though, because once I attend office hours, it clears up a lot of the confusion! (More about the TA below)",0,sp20
"I've least enjoyed the weekly quizzes because there are so many, but I understand the need for them and they do help me understand the lectures better",0,sp20

Lack of real world applications of wrangling data within the assignments,0,sp20
The fact that we are not lecturing in person but theres nothing we can do about that in this situattion,0,sp20

some topics are difficult,0,sp20
"The bulk of my worries with COGS108 comes from the assignments as they have been slightly tedious for me, mainly because I find myself getting confused at times due to the wording and that caused me to lose major points in A1. Also, I feel as though I was not entirely prepared for this course, since I did not have too much familiarity with Python, github, and datahub. Therefore, when doing the assignments I constantly find myself having to do more research that adds to the workload before I can understand if I am on the right track.",0,sp20
"This isn't really the fault of the class, but just online learning in general is difficult.",0,sp20
"The lecture quizzes, to be honest. I understand that the quizzes are meant to keep us on track when it comes to lecture material. However, I feel like (in my opinion), that there should be more flexibility when it comes to the quizzes. For example, in my opinion, there should be a little bit more time allotted for each question on the quiz, not 1 minute per question. I feel like allotting only one minute per question creates more pressure and its not enough time to come up with the correct answer or too look back at the notes to make sure/confirm the answer (especially when you accidentally missed something in the lectures). Also, allowing multiple attempts on the lecture quizzes could be nice too (without exposing the correct answers after taking it, of course), as this can make us look back at the lectures or lecture notes to see what we've missed and possibly got wrong. At the end of the day, it is your call as the professor. These are just suggestions to possibly consider to create a slightly better learning environment. Other than that though, no complaints :)",0,sp20
"I think the course is too spread out which causes the problem of too little attention for important topics. For example, while I was looking through the Linear Regression videos, I found that the videos did not nearly cover the detail required and that a lot of the important points were skimmed over too quickly. I have extensive experience in Statistics and in particular Linear Regression, but if I were a beginner who hadn't taken a college level Statistics course, I would really struggle to get all that detail in such a short space of time. To be clear, this isn't a criticism of teaching (Professor Ellis is one of the very best professors I've had the pleasure of learning from at UCSD), but one of time. I understand that quite a lot of topics need to be covered in this course, but perhaps the course can afford to lose some of the materials that are going to be covered to create time for future batches. 

Suggestion to fix this issue: After this quarter, the Professor will have a collection of videos which explain the topics really well. A possible solution is that some of the less engaging topics can be taught (say the earlier videos about Git and GitHub, some basic programming concepts such as pandas which students can easily pick up through online video and Jupyter Notebook Walkthroughs as well as by looking at the documentation available online) to the students via this medium while lecture time can be used for more engaging material (like going through the assumptions of Linear Regression and t-tests with more thoroughness and perhaps explaining the intuition behind those things, a full example of real-life data science projects etc).",0,sp20

I mean this in the best way possible, but I love that the lectures are designed as if they are for elementary school kids :) - basic, from the foundation, and straight forward. A lot of classes at UCSD, even the intro classes, sometimes just assume that we know X amount of information. I've also had professor's explicitly say they don't care if we don't like the method in which they're presenting the lectures or they ""don't believe in visuals"", etc etc. I've found this class engaging, exciting, and encouraging.

Using datahub to see applications of the material we are learning,1,fa20
The assignments,1,fa20
I enjoy the pace of the class thus far. I enjoy how the class does not assume much prior knowledge despite the fact that it is possible many individuals joined the class with said prior knowledge.,1,fa20
"I really enjoy the introduction to Python, data science, and jupyter notebooks. As a computer science major, I have yet to take any data science courses, but I am aware computer science is heavily involved in data science and I am glad this class has introduced me to field to see if I enjoy it. As someone who has also never coded in Python before, I think its useful that I am being introduced to the language. Lastly, knowing of Jupyter Notebooks for so long, I am glad to finally be learning the tool.",1,fa20
structure and organization of the course,1,fa20

I like that the lectures are posted before the weekend so that I can watch them over the weekend when I have more free time. ,1,fa20
"I know next to nothing about coding (save for writing loops and what I have so far learned in this class), and yet this class has already put the idea in my head of maybe wanting to be a data scientist. I enjoy the fact that the professor seems to have communicated the practice of data science effectively, and from the persuasive perspective of someone who enjoys doing it. Genuinely, thank you Professor Ellis for turning my most feared class of the quarter into my favorite one. ",1,fa20
the ease of doing lectures and quizzes,1,fa20
"Working with my group mates, this is my first time doing a data science project and it has been fun working with them and learning more",1,fa20

"Python, interesting lectures and guest speaker, ",1,fa20
I have learned how to deal with data and that is amazing.,1,fa20
I really like the coding portion from the assignments,1,fa20
"I am enjoying the Python applications of what we're leaning about statistics. I've spent time learning about it in theory, but using it in practice is always cool to implement and see. I've done so before with Math 185 in R, but Python feels more approachable for most people so it's interesting to try it there.",1,fa20
"I've enjoyed learning about data viz and how to use it, especially with the different libraries.",1,fa20
Learning to use python libraries to be able to actually do practical data science projects. Using the libraries like pandas and seaborn have helped me in my familiarity with these packages and confidence in performing more data science projects in the future. ,1,fa20

"I have enjoyed doing actual hands on work in Jupyter with pandas and dataframe, especially coming from a background of little coding knowledge. ",1,fa20
"I think I've enjoyed getting a more hands on experience with the coding aspect of the class, even though it is kind of difficult. It gives me experience with Python that I think is valuable both in class and outside the class too. I do especially enjoy the take home quizzes that makes the class easier to engage with the material. ",1,fa20
i enjoy the teaching style and pace. short video draw my attention that i do not easily lose my interest on those topics and the quiz are helpful for learning knowledge,1,fa20
Assignment,1,fa20
Clear lecture vide,1,fa20

I really like the asynchronous aspect of the course.,1,fa20
"Yes. I found COGS 108 is very helpful for my future career, and I can handle most of the materials of it.",1,fa20
The coding assignments. I appreciate how detailed the instructions and its clearly states what it wants us to do.,1,fa20
Experiencing the life of  a data scientist. It is a career that I am interested in.,1,fa20
The most interesting part of learning in COGS 108 is how much of can be applied to the real world problems. ,1,fa20
"The assignments, they are the hands on portion of what we learn in lecture",1,fa20
Learning Python is pretty interesting since I never thought of creating high-quality graphs from coding. ,1,fa20
"I like that the prerecorded videos are clear, concise, and edited down to the important points. ",1,fa20
Self-paced lectures,1,fa20
I enjoy deciding different kinds of graphs to use with different kinds of data. ,1,fa20
I love your lectures and how they are broken down. They are super informative and I don't fine myself loosing focus when I am watching them!,1,fa20
The bottom-up approach that assignments take in testing the material. I like how each assignment builds up to a large result (ie A3 with the final graph with linreg plotted).,1,fa20
The quizzes after each lecture allow me to truly see whether or not I understand the material that was taught in each video,1,fa20
The homework assigments,1,fa20
I enjoyed learning about data science techniques,1,fa20
Jupyter notebook is so exciting!,1,fa20
Learning how to use jupyter,1,fa20
the freedom to podcast whenever,1,fa20
I enjoy how informative the videos are,1,fa20
"What is a Data Analysis, how the data should be gathered before starting everything, how data should be prepared change my previous understanding of data science.",1,fa20
What I have enjoyed most about COGS 108 is how learning in this class is not impeded by natural instinct or talent in statistics or programming. Having the actual curiosity itself lends itself as a gateway to solving the problems when you are allowed to google things to experiment with and you have output to verify if your findings align with what is asked.,1,fa20
I enjoy the use of code in order to interpret and clean up data. I never knew that there were so many useful functions from programs like pandas and numpy that could streamline so many things.,1,fa20
Guest lecture! Vivian Peng is awesome!!!,1,fa20
The data visualization and tools have proven to be very useful. I am currently interning at Qualcomm and I immediately apply the knowledge I use in my work. ,1,fa20
Relatively clear expectations and well formatted lectures,1,fa20
"I enjoyed all the lessons on python coding, I know the point of this class is data analysis and not coding, but I really like coding. I also really like the way quizzes and videos are cut into chunks.",1,fa20
learning pandas. I think pandas would be useful in the future,1,fa20
Course video. Really help understand materials while maximize flexibility,1,fa20
the examples in class,1,fa20
"The homework, which gives very specific instructions and familiarizes me with the pandas package.",1,fa20
"I enjoy the lectures because although I'm not a Data Science major, it's always been something I've interested in, so it's cool to get exposed to this stuff!",1,fa20
Learning about and working with tools for data science. I've never done data science before so I enjoy working with pandas and analyzing data,1,fa20
The fact that it's in Python and we get to work on a project on our own. I love my team's project idea and I think it has motivated me to spend a lot of my off time writing code for it. ,1,fa20
I enjoyed the assignments and the office hours the most. I love how tutors explain the material so well to me and I hope it was more office hours or some 1-1 sessions. ,1,fa20
I have enjoyed the lectures about data visualization and things to be careful about. I had no idea how important this aspect of data science is.,1,fa20
The content I have learned in this course is really practical and useful.,1,fa20
"coding assignments, they're really fun to do because I feel like I'm applying the knowledge that I learned from class ",1,fa20
the good lectures and style of teaching,1,fa20
I have enjoyed some of the lectures. I think they are interesting and informative. ,1,fa20
The most interesting part of learning in COGS 108 is how much of can be applied to the real world problems. ,1,fa20
I actually like the Jupyter Notebook Python assignments as a way to learn about python and panda as I have no previous experience with the language,1,fa20
"I love the new topics we cover every week, and they're applicability in our data science project",1,fa20
The assignments are structured in a way that I actually learn the information asked,1,fa20
"Learning how to work with data using Python; lectures, including the guest speaker",1,fa20
the short videos every week ,1,fa20
"How the class is formatted, with no exams and lectures are videos that we can watch on our own time. I like these aspects because I feel less pressured to know everything in the course but am still actively learning.",1,fa20
I really enjoy the assignments. I find them challenging and fun to work on. ,1,fa20
The homework data were interesting. I didn't know tootsie roll was both fruity and chocolaty.,1,fa20
The fun and practical approach towards learning.,1,fa20
"The mini quizzes and the length of the short videos, but its rich, easily absorbable content. ",1,fa20
The videos and homework are clear,1,fa20
Python,1,fa20
"What I have enjoyed the most about COGS 108 so far are the lecture videos. They take less time than expected to complete, and are split up in a way so that I can take a break in between sets of videos.",1,fa20
Expanding my perspective on all the different things you can do with data and just how powerful and life-changing data can be. ,1,fa20
"the python, learning about what makes a data set good, what makes it bad.",1,fa20
it's more practical,1,fa20
"The assignments are very intuitive and basic and provide me with basic understanding of pandas and all the functionality that will be beneficial for a successful project. Therefore, I have enjoyed the assignments a lot.",1,fa20
"I honestly really liked the podcast-interview styled guest lecture with Vivian Peng. It was good to see the trajectory of someone's career (academic or otherwise) and how that related to data science, as well as having a few examples of how creativity and data science meet.",1,fa20
I like how there is a proper structure to the course.,1,fa20
Python basics.,1,fa20
I enjoy most on the material that is on the videos because they are very encouraging and interesting. The videos are where I learn the most. ,1,fa20
I have enjoyed learning how to use python and pandas. I did not feel confident with my coding skills but the assignments have helped me understand more the importance of syntax. ,1,fa20
The easy going pace of learning python,1,fa20
Piazza posts and videos. They are the most helpful with answering questions and are very useful,1,fa20
The guest lecturer. She really encouraged me and gave me so much hope for the future.,1,fa20
"I've been curious about data science but didn't know where to start, so I like the structured design and introduction of fundamentals that lead into more complex ideas",1,fa20
Python coding,1,fa20
Guest speakers since it is nice to hear their experiences and advice.,1,fa20
"I like how easy the lectures are to follow, I wish classes could be in person ,but I still find the lectures enjoyable and how each video is separated according to topic rather than having an hour long video with everything combined",1,fa20
Learning about data science and working with the pandas package. Working on the group project has also been fun so far.,1,fa20
The hands on nature of the assignments without being too difficult. ,1,fa20
I have enjoyed how flexible the course is and how I know due dates in advance ,1,fa20
It is cool that we can work on a read dataset,1,fa20
Being able to learn more about data analysis skills ,1,fa20
I enjoyed working with my group and being able to explore ideas with them.,1,fa20
"I have really enjoyed applying Python to the applications in this class. Coming from a cs background, I find it very valuable being able to apply my knowledge of programming in a different field like Data Science.",1,fa20
the guest lecture,1,fa20
"The videos are really well put together, informative, and concise.",1,fa20
The assignments. They are a challenge as I am new to programing and my last coding course was years ago but working through them has been rewarding,1,fa20
The mini lectures,1,fa20
Pacing of lecture (how information is broken up into manageable videos) and pandas library,1,fa20
PAs,1,fa20
The lecture recordings + the guest lecturer,1,fa20
The quick videos that I actually remember,1,fa20
"Using what we learn in lectures in our programming assignments, something I missed in COGS9",1,fa20
Group Project,1,fa20
The lectures are interesting,1,fa20
I've really liked being able to code again as the Cogs department is rather sparse in coding courses.,1,fa20
The assignments,1,fa20
The videos are the perfect length for understanding concepts,0,fa20
Assignment is kind of difficult to me. I never learned how to google some concepts,0,fa20
"Honestly, I am not a huge fan of remote learning, I would say thats the biggest problem right now. I feel like it takes away from the actual COGS 108 experience.",0,fa20
I'm not familiar with python and panda.,0,fa20
hmmm I feel like I am a little bit lost on how to conduct the final project along the course cause we are constantly learning new techniques,0,fa20
Nothing really so far. It's been nice.,0,fa20
On the homeworks I have to consistently struggle on questions and look up functions and syntax on google because I did not learn them from lecture,0,fa20
super random but I don't like how the lecture videos don't open a new tab when I click on them from github. but obviously this is a very minor thing,0,fa20
"I don't really have any major beef with this class so far, so I can't really complain.",0,fa20
I honestly think all parts of COGS 108 has been great so far!,0,fa20
On the homeworks I have to consistently struggle on questions and look up functions and syntax on google because I did not learn them from lecture,0,fa20
Some of the assignment multiple choice questions. They can be tricky at times.  ,0,fa20
i feel like there are too many quizzes and that it is stressful to keep up with constantly ,0,fa20
"This was the very first time I ever had to use github (not a Cogs major so definitely new to this) and I felt that there were very little guidance I was given to validate that component of the assignment (it wasn't a lot of work, but it was worth a lot and I had no way of knowing if I did it correctly). I lost a point for a silly reason - but I spent around 15-30 min on that portion as opposed to the 3 hours on the actual assignment of the material that was taught on class. To lose 13% of the entire assignment (or 1% of my entire grade) for that mistake was pretty hurtful.",0,fa20
Nothing to be honest.,0,fa20
Quiz on guest talk,0,fa20
Writing out my project proposal because writing is my weak point,0,fa20
No complaints.,0,fa20
The Final Project - a lot of freedom and flexibility ,0,fa20
I think during lecture we don't really go in depth into different concepts and they can only really be reinforced or learned by doing the assignments.,0,fa20
"I don't really like doing lecture quizzes, but I do them early so they're not too bad.",0,fa20
So far so good!,0,fa20
A3 was not released on Monday as it was promised; it was released on Tuesday instead. And no one responded during these times that A1 was being graded; might be nice to have one dedicated answerer during these times tbh,0,fa20
What I've liked least is that some of the main course documents are only on GitHub while I think some of the important ones should be on Canvas as well just for easier access. ,0,fa20
The individual proposal felt sort of confusing to do since our data set is predetermined.,0,fa20
The quiz answers can be tricky sometimes. ,0,fa20
"Sometimes it's difficult to get help because there are so many students in office hours, but I understand that it's such a big class and all the TAs are very helpful. ",0,fa20
"I have enjoyed the project proposal the least because it had asked us to prepare a possible question before we learned the different models and data science experiments (e.g. exploratory, inferential, etc.)",0,fa20
Slow feedback time on assignment grades (especially if an autograder grades it),0,fa20
"Group work - It takes up too much energy to work with 4 other UCSD students over the zoom call. Also,  I feel like everyone's expectation in this class is different.",0,fa20
"It can be difficult to pay attention to some of the longer lecture videos (that go through the notebooks, for example) without taking a lot of breaks.",0,fa20
Spending time debugging my coding errors,0,fa20
"1. The longer video lectures mostly because they are on the Python notebook and it's a little harder to take notes about code going on. I usually just download the notebook as a pdf and take notes on it directly as appropriate.
2. I really don't like that I can't see the answers on the quizzes right away. I never go back to check them because I always forget (also because I do them the weekend it is released and answers come out a week later so I don't even remember the ones I got wrong by then). I wished it were unlimited trys because I think it would've given me more incentive to know the right answers as I am taking the quiz.",0,fa20
the final project with less directions,0,fa20
I wish there were some synchronous lectures.,0,fa20
The video quizzes. Some questions are really confusing and not representative.,0,fa20
The quiz is sometime hard.,0,fa20
"quiz
I always got one question wrong",0,fa20
"project, as communication through zoom is not effective",0,fa20
I think having live lectures (that are recorded to later go back to) rather than recorded videos would be beneficial to maintain that classroom interaction between students and the professor.,0,fa20
"Question design of quiz/assignment. Some quiz questions have multiple viable answers, but some aren't considered correct because they aren't explicitly mentioned in the lecture. A1's git task might need extra guidance for students once waitlisted, and it might not want to deduct points solely based on naming errors. ",0,fa20
The content quizzes,0,fa20
I think the lectures are kind of long and they take me twice as long to do because I pause to take notes for them. ,0,fa20
I wish there was a more set/required time frame for final project progress to keep us on track.,0,fa20
The project proposal was confusing to me to do as an individual project. I wish the individual project could be done over the term as well. I am worried about doing the individual project during the last week of classes.,0,fa20
"Tis a great class, I don't think there is anything I particularly dislike.",0,fa20
It makes me want to cry because of how I don't understand sometimes. ,0,fa20
"I would prefer the due date for the Friday quizzes be on Saturday at least, because unlike the Monday and Wednesday quizzes, it feels much stricter.",0,fa20
Quizzes ,0,fa20
The daily quizzes are the worst.,0,fa20
"I like the quizzes the least. I often feel that I have gotten a good understanding of the lecture videos but still didn't do well in quizzes. Also, it happened to me once that I mistakenly started a quiz next to the one I wanted to click, and ended up getting almost 0 points since I haven't watched the corresponding video yet. I think it would be better if we could get 2 chances for a single quiz, and this could also help us to recapture the contents that we were not familiar enough too.",0,fa20
I wish the assignments were released earlier so that I could better allocate my time,0,fa20
I think the grading is a bit too harsh.,0,fa20
The A# have been rather tedious so far,0,fa20
The assignments are a bit long.,0,fa20
"I dislike the style of the lecture quizzes, mainly how there's only one attempt. It's adding additional stress to the course that I don't think is necessary, because it would be nice to be able to watch the videos without having to worry so much about performing well on the quizzes. ",0,fa20
nothing really to hate,0,fa20
"Pressure on the quizzes; sometimes the time limit feels too short, especially for questions such as the ones asking what graph would be the best choice for a given situation",0,fa20
"The quizzes are a (very) tiny bit anxiety inducing. Although I put my focus on the videos, the quizzes make me question myself quite a bit, especially when there are select all questions where some answers cause me confusion. ",0,fa20
"More coding tutoring (supplemental materials) is needed because I don't have a strong background in python, so it took a longer time for me to try out and process things. ",0,fa20
I guess the assignments since a lot of it we have to figure out on our own so a question can take a long while to solve. ,0,fa20
Nothing.,0,fa20
I like everything about this class,0,fa20
taking content quizes ,0,fa20
The week1 quizzes are tricky.,0,fa20
"The main project. I posed a question that I found interesting and did background research, but since turning it in, you have discussed predictive analysis and text analysis. I want to try these out in my project, but I don't know if I can change. I kinda wish there was a slack or piazza channel for the people doing the individual projects to discuss. ",0,fa20
The daily quizzes are probably what I like least about the class because some of the questions have been a bit ambiguous. ,0,fa20
Nothing worth noting,0,fa20
Answering quizes,0,fa20
I wish have more explain on the code part of the lecture.,0,fa20
Group Project work,0,fa20
"Don't have a lot practice, I think I will forget things fast.",0,fa20
"Some questions in quizzes are not so straightforward, and having only one attempt and limited time can be stressful.",0,fa20
Feeling unconfident in my final project group,0,fa20
Vague participation quiz questions,0,fa20
There is a lot of Python I need to learn.,0,fa20
"sometimes the videos each week take me a while because I like to take notes, and the quiz questions are sometimes unfair since there could be multiple answers.",0,fa20
The individual project proposal was challenging for me since I knew nothing about the data set so it might have been nice to know that my question was at least a little bit more on track,0,fa20
"The quizzes for each lecture. The quizzes are very difficult and I have lost a lot of points because of how specific they are. I think that if they are truly trying to gauge our understanding of the lecture we should have two or three attempts on each quiz. After submission we should be able to see which we got correct and which were wrong, not the correct answers. Then we should have the opportunity to retake it. I understand that we can miss points on the quizzes and still earn an A in the course but it should not be this difficult to earn these points if you just want to make sure we watch the lectures and understand the material.",0,fa20
"These EC surveys! This is the first one I've done, for some reason I didn't know about them until now. Prob missed a lot of free points!",0,fa20
Not much; Professor Ellis has been doing a great job so far. ,0,fa20
The final project because I dont know how it will turn out,0,fa20
"What I like least is probably the quizzes. I feel like there's a lot of quizzes, and while most of them are  not hard, there a few that I felt weren't really supposed to be taken right after watching the lecture but instead meant to be taken after I have had practice with the concept",0,fa20
some lecture quiz questions are too difficult,0,fa20
more structure for the group project/more support from TA/IA's,0,fa20
"I guess I find the Jupyter notebook videos very dense and technical, but they're supposed to be that way and are helpful in completing assignments as a result. ",0,fa20
"The thing I like least about COGS 108 so far is that it stacks on top of my COGS 109 assignments and the only other coding-based class i've taken is COGS 18 so I can feel a bit overwhelmed with learning how to do things sometimes. But with the class itself, I actually enjoy it a lot!",0,fa20
"I feel like there is a slight disconnect from our final project and the class itself. I understand that we are learning the tools we need for our project in lecture, but I don't feel like we can immediately apply these specific learning points in such an open-ended project. Maybe it would be helpful to have weekly project goals connected to the weekly lecture content.",0,fa20
Lack of guidance in some of the homework where syntax is very specific,0,fa20
"My least favorite part of the course are the video quizzes only because we only have one attempt. I appreciate the fact that we get 10 free points toward the quizzes, but maybe with multiple attempts we could have a better chance at getting 100% on the quizzes and not need the 10 free points.",0,fa20
I enjoy this class,0,fa20
Probably the lecture quizzes just because I get thrown on every multiple-answer question and miss it.,0,fa20
"The quizzes. The quizzes stress me out since we have them every other day and there aren't many points to them, so if I missed one point, I basically failed the quiz. ",0,fa20
"The quizzes. I wish they weren't timed because I think I would do better on them given more time. While I am actively listening and taking notes over the videos, I do miss some details that are brought up in the quiz and I wish I had more time to go back and revisit that topic (especially if it is important enough to be covered on the quiz). ",0,fa20
"I don't really like how quizzes have to be done the day of by midnight, because sometimes i have a hectic day with other classes, work, and other things",0,fa20
It is ok. Thank you!,0,fa20
Very rare but sometimes I feel like the quiz questions were more vague or had multiple interpretations for certain ones ,0,fa20
"I wish for the quizzes we had an additional try or at least deadline extended to Saturday because every quiz (besides Friday) has a few days to be completed, so it would make sense for the Friday quiz to at least have one day of leniency.",0,fa20
the quizzes feel more of a requirement than an actual learning check ,0,fa20
I don't enjoy working on individual project so far because everything is virtual and it is harder for me to ask for help. It also seems very intimidating to finish up a Data science project on my own without much coding knowledge and without in person help. ,0,fa20
"Possibly because of the COVID-19 environment, but I do miss the feeling of being in a legitimate lecture environment and having synchronous lectures, as it gives me more of reason to actually attend lecture.",0,fa20
Quiz questions are too ambiguous,0,fa20
The PAs are a little bit challenging. I feel that lecture videos do not do a sufficient job in  preparing me for the PA,0,fa20
I wish there was a synchronous lecture at least once a week because it feels like I'm just self learning.,0,fa20
"I feel as though I'm not encouraged to take notes at all. I find it hard to take notes in coding classes, but even here still with more concepts, I find that I don't reach for my notebook often to write down important concepts. This could be a me problem, though, because the slides do have bullet points that outline the lesson and what you're going to say.",0,fa20
"I know professor give us easiest quzzies, but I feel that the time is too short.",0,fa20
some quiz questions can be tricky,0,fa20
There is not too much help regarding programming like CSE with the tutor labs.,0,fa20
I think that Python should be the only prerequisite for the course as opposed to Java. It would have been easier to start out with more comfortability in Python before starting the class.,0,fa20
None of I can think of so far.,0,fa20
Quizzes because a lot of the questions can be a bit confusing with the wording. ,0,fa20
I think some of the questions have been frustratingly ambiguous every once in a while. 95% of the time they are good representations of the content in the videos but every once in a while the answer is definitely not clear even if you watched the video.  ,0,fa20
Too easy. As a DSC major who has taken DSC10-80 much of the course is repeated material for me,0,fa20
The final project weights too much and becomes too decisive to our grades.,0,fa20
"The stress, since it is something that does not come easily to me, having to code is hard for me to understand sometimes, formatting specifically is what trips me up.",0,fa20
"I have least liked the pace of the class. For the first few weeks, everything seemed to be going off at a good pace, however, I feel now that we are moving a bit fast. ",0,fa20
"Working on the group project, it has been difficult logistically for us to work on the project",0,fa20
"There are too many quizzes, although manageable. Some questions in the first two weeks' quizzes are too detailed. ",0,fa20
Tricky canvas quiz questions,0,fa20
I miss raising my hand and asking questions in real time. ,0,fa20
The video quizzes being due the same day the video is released. It's been ok so far but the asynchronicity of my classes has made scheduling myself to do these quizzes sometimes difficult.,0,fa20
I like everything,0,fa20
A1,0,fa20
"I'm just mad I saved this class for last because it's the last class I need before graduating. Overall really great course, lectures are easy to follow, and assignments are fun.",0,fa20
"A few of the quizzes had questions that weren't related to the material discussed in the lecture (the data viz lectures, iirc)",0,fa20
I feel like I'm learning very slowly and I'm worried my level of coding is making it hard for me to contribute a lot for my group.,0,fa20
Doesn't feel like the hw and lectures are solidly connected,0,fa20
What I have like the least about COGS 108 has been having to write the project proposal. I disliked that because I feel like I didn't have enough knowledge of the tools I'm able to use for the project in order to form a plan on what topic I was choosing. ,0,fa20
Honestly. I wish that the reading quizzes had unlimited time. I don't see a reason to add such a short time period other than to make it more difficult. ,0,fa20
"I am struggling the most with the fact of how hard it can be to handle work for both the project, the lectures, the quizzes, and the assignments. The project takes many more hours than expected, and so far the only thing that keeps me going and makes me prioritize this class over others is my interest in the project. It could help a lot to have a bit more guidance on our projects, so that we can stay on track with time and find resources on time. ",0,fa20
"Nothing, I am really enjoying the class so far!",0,fa20
"Things in the assignments are not always explained in the lectures so I get confused as to how to do some things in the assignment, especially more complicated things.",0,fa20
"The sudden change in assignment due date frequency. I know that the schedule made it clear when assignments were due, but I was used to the two week gap between each assignment and now there is a one week gap.",0,fa20
"I find it generally quite hard to focus on the videos. Lastly, I think there is a lot of pressure to perform well on the quizzes and they often have questions that are a little tricky.",0,fa20
Project proposal instructions were ambiguous,0,fa20
Prof introduces little codes,0,fa20
the video quiz part. I think sometimes questions were very tricky and cannot represent the material we learn,0,fa20
I think the assignment has too low total score and it causes 1 point deduction on the total grade if we got 1 point deducted on one homework.,0,fa20
I think the assignment takes a very large part on total grade and have too low total points for each assignment. Therefore 1 point deducted on one assignment will cause one point deducted on the total average grade.,0,fa20
I like everything,0,fa20
I don't really like the weekly quizzes although I do understand that they are necessary.,0,fa20
"Learning git, github, and anaconda. Not especially a bad thing--it was just on the more difficult end for me",0,fa20
trying to actually find data sets for the project,0,fa20
"I dislike the ambiguity of some questions because it felt like some of the 'select all that apply' could have more or fewer answers depending on how the question was considered. However, I feel like last week's was definitely less ambiguous. ",0,fa20
Nothing that quickly comes to mind.,0,fa20
The online format could be better. More interaction with students is what I mean. It is hard to do it through canvas so not really a complaint but just my opinion.,0,fa20
"Not about COGS 108, but I probably should have waited a bit to refine my coding skills a bit more before I take this class.",0,fa20
The proposal took a long time to be returned. I want it to be returned soon so I can send out surveys which will take a long time,0,fa20
I can't think of anything that I do not like in the class.,0,fa20
"Maybe deadlines for things can be extended til saturday and not just friday. For this week, we have the daily quiz and the A3 due on the same night.",0,fa20
"I dislike how quizzes are graded. For most of my other classes with quizzes, they are graded for effort, which usually means if you scored a certain percentage of the quiz correctly (e.g. 75%) you get full points. Having a leeway of 10 points to cover for a missed week coupled on with points lost due to minor errors in quizzes can add up by the end of the quarter and make somewhat of an impact on the final grade.",0,fa20
I've disliked the project proposal because the topic was not very interesting to me.,0,fa20
"Learning how to use Git commands was definitely difficult despite carefully watching the lecture videos about that topic. The commands seem straightforward in lecture, but in practice doing a simple commit push was very ambiguous in practice since the UI is very complicated and everyones personal machines are different.

The guest lecture ,0,fa20
I wouldn't say I don't like it but I feel unprepared as of now for the group project.,0,fa20
Learning new tools.,0,fa20
"My least favorite part of the class might be working on the final project. It's definitely the hardest part of the class for me. I love working with my group, but the work expected from me each week has been slightly overwhelming. With it already being Week 5, I feel like we haven't made much progress, and I'm feeling a lot of pressure. In addition, the final project is so open-ended that it gives us more chances to make more mistakes in our project.",0,fa20
"The quizzes weigh heavy on me because I have used up the free 10 points already and usually, I miss on average 1-3 questions every week, so I am nervous that my grade will continue to drop. ",0,fa20
"The quizzes can sometimes have some vague questions, but overall I think the quality of the quizzes is fine and it is just a nitpick. ",0,fa20
the quiz should not set a deadline bc sometimes too busy to finish on time ,0,fa20
"The amount of work, pace of the course, and lack of connection between python notebook and lecture videos/notebooks.",0,fa20
Too many quizzes,0,fa20
Some hard concepts,0,fa20

It's very easy to lose points. Especially for our final project. I'm confused about how it will be graded.,0,fa20
Nothing so far.,0,fa20
"i think this class is perfect. right speed, good lecture videos. One thing I miss is going to lecture in person but obviously that isnt possible right now.",0,fa20
My LEAST liked part of COGS 108 are the quizzes they are not always reflective of the material taught and ambiguous.,0,fa20
"One attempt per quiz, laptop has died in the middle of a quiz and by the time I was able to go back to the quiz it was a poor score. ",0,fa20
The syntax was went over fairly quickly and I am not sure I would have to remember the syntax. ,0,fa20

"Github, This is the first time I learn about Github. It sounds so sophisticated to me.",0,fa20
"The part that I liked least about COGS 108 is the process of finding a group for the final project, as it was difficult for me to find group members when people I asked did not seem to respond right away, while also forgetting to clear themselves from the teammate search once they had their group. I did not want to just ask too many different people and just work with whoever responds 1st in 1st come 1st serve type of manner since I felt I'd be disrespectful to those I bothered to ask, so I waited patiently to get responses from people I heard from 1st. Unfortunately, that costed me several days in the process of finding group members.",0,fa20

Missing tooo many points on those video quizzes :(,0,fa20
Taking quizzes for each lecture video,0,fa20
"Course content quizzes. I understand why they're a thing. It gets everyone in the class to watch the lecture videos. But I think the questions on there are way too niche. A lot of the questions don't focus on the general picture of the lectures or sometimes they ask ambiguous questions that may have multiple answers. For example, in one of our recent quizzes, we were asked two questions where we were given scenarios and had to pick the applicable confounding variable. Due to the fact that the question is more qualitative, it is bound to be ambiguous, but I'd be cool if it was a little more clear cut. But then again, it might just be me. ",0,fa20
"the quizzes are not my favorite. they are not that hard, but sometimes I make stupid mistakes, I hope there was more attempts for quizzes. ",0,fa20
"The quizzes. I feel like sometimes the quiz questions are a bit more advanced from lecture, which can be a good thing, but I don't know to expect it right after just watching the lecture.",0,fa20
The quiz is a little bit difficult than expected.,0,fa20
The lecture videos keep getting longer and longer and I don't have a large attention span anymore so I feel like I'm not getting a lot of information from them. I think it would be better to break them up into smaller videos of subtopics.,0,fa20
Nothing to complain about honestly,0,fa20
"I don't like the quizzes. They don't take me that long to complete the quizzes, however even though I take thorough notes, sometimes the questions are ambigious and are hard to answer, so I have missed a lot of points. ",0,fa20
My LEAST liked part of COGS 108 are the quizzes they are not always reflective of the material taught and ambiguous.,0,fa20
I think the project is a very daunting task made even more difficult with how groups are now separated. Being able to find a window within multiple student's schedule in the middle of this pandemic (and political chaos) is extremely difficult.,0,fa20
"The remote nature of the class, but there's nothing we can do about it :(",0,fa20
I was a bit unclear about the individual project proposal when it was initially assigned,0,fa20
"Group project; since this is anonymous, to be honest I wish I could have met and gotten to know my members beforehand rather than basically having to choose at random (based on piazza posts), especially since it counts for such a big part of my grade. It's a bit frustrating and kind of unfair imo. Either that or group projects shouldn't count for this much of the grade. It's hard to think these things through at the beginning of the quarter when deciding.  I also don't like that the class is remote; makes everything feel weird, including for group projects. idk

I accidentally submitted A1 late because I initially had a hard time keeping track of everything via canvass in my classes, so that was annoying, especially since I think I ended up getting everything correct. I don't think that's anyone's fault though, just a frustration on my end.

But otherwise I love the class content and class structure and think it's been very well designed. I wish Professor Ellis had more office hours throughout the week.",0,fa20
I have not really enjoyed having to take a quiz after every lecture video. I personally find having to take 7-10 quizzes a week slightly excessive but I do see the value in taking the quizzes. ,0,fa20
"final project, hard to decide what to do and how to begin",0,fa20
There is nothing in particular that I dislike about the class.,0,fa20
Some of the quiz questions are just a test on verbatim.,0,fa20
"The amount of emphasis on ""perfect memory"" for the quizzes. Human error combined with current circumstances kind of make it natural to get less than 95% of all points across all weeks. More ""free points"" or extra quiz questions(similar difficulty, or feedback related, for maybe a couple of points every week) would be helpful.",0,fa20

There are no live lectures,0,fa20
Group meeting,0,fa20
What I have liked the least about COGS 108 so far is the group project. Learning the material and completing the assignments on my own is already a lot of work. Having to worry about a different project where you have to depend on other people is too much given the world's current situation and my home environment.,0,fa20
I feel like I haven't had enough time to delve super deep into the topics because of my other classes : (,0,fa20

The quizzes can be pressuring sometimes. ,0,fa20
The pressure of the final project. I am having a hard time to be able to meet with my team and work on the project. I now sort of wish that I worked on the solo project that way I don't feel like I'm bringing my team down or vice versa.,0,fa20
honestly the final project. I don't really feel like there's a lot of instructor input so it is a little difficult to do a lot of outside work but hopefully that is just because we are just starting going through the datasets this week,0,fa20
"One assignment every few weeks. I think I would have preferred mini assignments to solidify class concepts that involved programming, rather than the concept check quizzes, because I feel like I would retain everything a bit better that way. ",0,fa20

"I enjoy about learning python. I think learning pandas package enable me to clean my data in more efficient way. Also, I achieve a better tool to express my data, when I learned data visualization.",1,wi21
Mainly being able to explore the field of data science and tools to work with and analyze real data out there in the world. I think it's cool to be able to work with the data to be able to deduce interesting stats or facts that are not easily seen without tools.,1,wi21

Applying skills from COGS18 to real-world scenarios such as experimenting.  My python skills are not being exercised.,1,wi21
"The process. It could be ugly at the start of a assignments, but it comes together and I learn the ins and outs through struggling and trial and error. ",1,wi21
I enjoy learning Python and especially how I can apply that in my future career. It is a new programming language to me as I only know Java so far. But learning Python is helpful and I know more about how scientists can put the data together to answer questions.,1,wi21
"What I have enjoyed the most are the detailed responses from emails. The large amount of feedback is rare to see, and it makes it much easier to stay on the right track for the project.",1,wi21
Love the lectures and the amount of information given during them. It does not seem like it's overwhelming. It feels like the perfect amount :) ,1,wi21
Learning how to use pandas has been incredibly useful for other classes. ,1,wi21

"I like the hands-on experience I've been getting with Python in relation to its applications with data wrangling and data visualization designs. I feel like having so many opportunities for hands-on learning has really solidified the fundamentals of using Python to perform data analytics, and Prof. Ellis always offers clear, easy-to-understand instruction whenever getting us started on the basics.",1,wi21

"I've enjoyed learning Python and the overall organization of the course. I've been meaning to learn Python for a long time and it's nice to have the chance to both learn and apply it to assignments and projects. In terms of the organization, it's really nice that students know pretty much exactly what to expect week to week as it allows us to plan ahead in relation to other classes as well.",1,wi21
Hands on learning of seaborn and pandas. Also just the idea of fermi estimation (which I will now use for the rest of my life).,1,wi21
"I have most enjoyed the team aspect of COGS 108. As a computer science major, it is refreshing to be able to work with a larger team and be able to hear the thoughts and ideas of many other people. I like that this class revolves around such an interesting project where there is a large amount of flexibility, such as free choice of topic. ",1,wi21
"I'm really not a fan of the material, but I like how Prof Ellis walks us through the notebooks and how the coding stuff is explained very clearly. Having the explanations in the class notebooks makes doing the discussion labs and assignments a lot easier since I can usually check the class notebook and reliably find the code I need.",1,wi21

"The group project. I think it is really productive and helpful to feel what group coordination would be like in the real world, like in a job or research prosition.",1,wi21
"The class rhythm is good for me and because there is no midterm and final, it gives me more time to figure out what's the meaning behind each question. I think I can learn more in this way.",1,wi21
I liked exploring ways to represent different visualizations using same dataset and the importance of ethics in data science was intriguing too.,1,wi21
"I enjoyed learning about the different data files, such as CSV, JSON files, and learning about how to use pandas to create different datasets and tables.",1,wi21
"I like the structure of the class and how we work in teams. It makes me feel less stressed in knowing that I have a team to collaborate with this quarter instead of having to do a huge project on my own. I think that even though its through zoom, it offers students the ability to chat and get to know each other in a time where that is limited not only in our social and personal lives but also in school work. I think its a nice break and overall makes me feel more confident in the class.",1,wi21
I have enjoyed the learning of python. I can now easily use this language to analyze data.,1,wi21
"I enjoy learning the python library pandas. I know it is an important skill for data analyze, it is worth to learn in this class since it will be more helpful for my future career!",1,wi21
"I enjoy doing the assignments, it is pretty difficult with no python experience and I am also not great at coding, so it does take a lot of time, but figuring out the code when Im stuck can be fun sometimes. ",1,wi21
"Learning about pandas, it is very interesting",1,wi21
"The class is very structured and despite having many assignments, they're all due on Friday every week, so it's easy to remember. ",1,wi21
Learning about ethics in COGS 108 was really interesting for me but I am biased because I love when ethics are involved in anything,1,wi21
I liked learning to do different types of plots using seaborn/matplotlib/pandas,1,wi21
The lecture and homework structure is super clear.,1,wi21
A lot of resources; reasonable amount of workload. ,1,wi21
"The content of the course is really helpful, and I think I actually learn something about how to apply data science.",1,wi21
"The thing I have enjoyed MOST about COGS 108 so far is working on the group project. During this time of remote learning, I believe things like group projects help people feel less isolated and give students an opportunity to better connect with their peers.",1,wi21
I like working with a team and learning from other team members.,1,wi21
I like the pace of lecture and assignments. It's almost a perfect balance of being able to learn a lot at an optimal level without having excessive stress.,1,wi21
I enjoy the option to watch the lectures asynchronously such that I can watch the lectures at my own pace and pause when I need to.,1,wi21

In classes where I have no control over my teammate, I find it very difficult to hold my teammates accountable and thus my grade was affected. I also like the optional discussion/lab. I have learned a lot from the discussion while not having to worry about losing points during the process.",1,wi21
I've enjoyed everything for the most part. I feel like I'm learning a lot in regards to data science and the curriculum is interesting and engaging..,1,wi21
"I enjoyed the amount of time we get to complete the assignments. A lot of us having a lot going on, so it's nice to not be on a time crunch for everything.",1,wi21
The live lectures are really nice,1,wi21
I enjoyed most about how we get to practice the skills that we need in Jupytr notebook. I feel like the assignments and discussion are helpful. ,1,wi21
I'm glad that i learned how to wrangle dataset and create colorful plots to find relationship between numbers and objects.,1,wi21
"Although the most difficult, I have truly enjoyed the Assignments in the class so far. Although we've only done the assignments on the easier end, I've enjoyed tackling each problem, and have found myself surprised at how much I've learned! I really enjoy the open-ended type of questions that allow me to think about what strategies I can use - although the occasional hints are also extremely helpful! ",1,wi21
Learning how to use the different python libraries.,1,wi21
"For a class that has a coding prerequisite, I like how the professor is still taking the time to explain basic concepts instead of rushing right in. Without having a strong coding background, I am still able to follow along most of the times and the pacing allows for slow listeners and slow learners to not fall behind.",1,wi21
"Seeing how I can  use code to find the average  of my data or any other information I need from a data frame is something I have enjoyed. It is pretty neat that I do not have to go through all the data, but instead I can write a  a code that will fetch the data for me. ",1,wi21
"I like that most of the material (python libraries, EDA, and ethics) isn't being made unnecessarily difficult. For me personally and where I'm gauging myself at, just having more exposure to and having the chance to practice these basics? is super helpful. It's encouraging to not be drowning in new material for once. Instead of stressing out learning new things, I get practice with important skills, something that I feel other courses don't offer.",1,wi21
The thing I enjoyed most about COGS108 so far is learning about how to take csv files from websites and making them into datasets. The assignments are very fair,1,wi21
I enjoy programming in Python and trying to plot various data. I have a lot of experience in Python but I do not have that much experience in interpreting and cleaning data like this.,1,wi21
Working with my group members. Establishing new connections.,1,wi21
I enjoy the format and the digestible information is great for people new to data science,1,wi21
Learning Python and web scraping.,1,wi21
Assignments,1,wi21
"I really like the group project and the structure involved in the deadlines and instructions. It feels very structured, and helps us really understand how to structure and communicate to be able to do a project with others and what deadlines are necessary",1,wi21
I enjoy learning about the ability to make data models which I want to use later for Machine Learning,1,wi21
"Really learning about how to question data around the world and the fact that discussion labs, which are a bit more simple compared to assignments, can be used in substitute for final grade. ",1,wi21
Lectures aren't so condensed that both conceptual and technical content (like specific functions) put together. They're also recorded and rarely go over time.,1,wi21
"I think I've enjoyed importing and learning about different uses for python that apply toward data science and analysis in the real world. Prior to this, I had been wondering how exactly my Cogs degree would result in me being able to be qualified in analytical data, so now that we're doing it, it feels pretty satisfying.",1,wi21
Working on the assignments - it's a nice way to get introduced to Python.,1,wi21
"I've largely enjoyed the teaching style. Professor Ellis is very clear with her explanations for the various different aspects of the course, especially when we go over python/pandas/etc.",1,wi21
Making beautiful viz!,1,wi21
HOMEWORK,1,wi21
Working on the group project during this pandemic makes me feel like i am not alone and also going to the OH and chat with the tutors.,1,wi21
learning about python because I didn't know much going in,1,wi21
Doing the Discussion question,1,wi21
I've enjoyed the Assignments the most. I feel like I'm learning as I walk through them.,1,wi21
The clear lectures! They're easy to follow and introduces the topics well.,1,wi21
Learning how to incorporate data science into our lives,0,wi21
"I really did not enjoy learning ethnic part. Although I think it is a very important topic, I still think it is kind of boring. I am glad the rest lectures are amazing and engaging.",0,wi21
"Since I have to say something I guess it'll be that it can be a little confusing to know what exactly the assignments are asking for in some questions, or what specific method it wants us to use and how.",0,wi21
PDF lecture notes should be put on Canvas,0,wi21
"At first, I felt that the Data Ethics or Data Privacy sections were unnecessary. HOWEVER, I soon realized that they are valid concerns because neither I would like my data to be nonconsentially used and these are topics that are often undermined.",0,wi21
final project,0,wi21
PDF lecture notes should be put on Canvas,0,wi21
"The pace, but I understand this is an introductory course, and I did take the course for this reason, so this is not a valid criticism.",0,wi21
Discussion questions being vague,0,wi21
"The difficulty of some packages such as pandas.  Some stuff feel harder than they should, like graphing.",0,wi21
The stress about it all. Thank Goodness there is no test involving executing code ,0,wi21
I cannot think of anything that I like least about COGS 108. Everything seems good so far to me,0,wi21
"This one is hard to say, but I think I least enjoy the discussion section assignments, mainly because the discussion section assignments together tend to take longer than the assignments, which is due to my lack of knowledge in Python, pandas, etc.",0,wi21
"Since I am still not so comfortable with coding, the assignments are still a bit overwhelming. ",0,wi21
The programming skill level varies too much in the class which makes group projects hit or miss. ,0,wi21
in general its just hard for me to grasp coding concepts but thats not specific to this class,0,wi21
"In terms of assignments, I didn't like D3. I wasn't able to extract the topics/code covered in lecture to complete D3 in an efficient way, and I struggled a lot on making the proportions, spending hours on it. ",0,wi21
"Lecture examples for data visualization tended to be more simple than for the discussion lab, which resulted in quite some frustration compared to earlier experiences with discussion submissions. I understand that in the beginning of the quarter, we were already warned that we would need to do a lot of Googling (and honestly, I have no complaints about doing so, because I have found the overall research experience to be more enlightening than painstaking), but I feel like the class would have benefitted if more challenging examples had been included in the lecture.   ",0,wi21

Working with my group has been a little frustrating given that we are all remote and disconnected. At times they can be quite unresponsive.,0,wi21
"Length and helpfulness of technical discussion sections. It would be more helpful if instead of going over previously written code (like the D3 Baby names), the TA's actually coded in Pandas/seaborn in front of us, this would help us see the process more clearly.",0,wi21
"I have least liked the timed quizzes that we must take each Friday. While they do encourage us to go over the material and solidify our understanding of the lectures, I think they shouldn't be timed as 15 minutes to take a quiz online can sometimes be stressful. ",0,wi21
"Again, I really am not interested in data science in general so it's been kind of hard to keep myself motivated for this class (especially when the COGS department won't let us P/NP like other departments have been doing, but that's a whole other can of worms...). But I don't have anything I dislike in particular about the way the course is run, and I'm grateful that even though there are quite a few small assignments every week, none of them feel like busy work and are actually helpful for me since I'm not as strong with coding.",0,wi21
Everything is doing great! ,0,wi21
this final project,0,wi21
documentation on programming pandas can be difficult to apply to assignment,0,wi21
I find that the discussions are quite long and can be rather tedious. I think shortening them to a more clear cut practice would serve to be better. ,0,wi21
"There are a lot of new terminologies and when I was doing technical discussion, a lot of stuff was barely covered in the class, hence it was a little bit stressful. ",0,wi21
"I think I would like discussions and Assignments to be combined, because to me it feels like there are too many different things due to keep track of.",0,wi21
Discussion 3 is somewhat difficult for me. There is one question taking me about 2 hours but I still miss it.,0,wi21
D3 was too hard to complete as it did not have much guidance given that it is supposed to help us with assignments. A2 was way easier than D3.,0,wi21
"I least enjoyed the actual coding and programming aspects of using pandas, as it can get a little confusing learning the syntax and code.",0,wi21
The thing I like the least is probably having so many things due on Fridays. It bunches up for me and its managable but it wouldnt have been my preference to have everything due on one day. But maybe having 2/3 due on friday and one due on saturday or sunday since I work during the week and the weekend has more study and homework time for me.,0,wi21
"I know that the ethics are important for data analysis, but it is kind of boring. Also, I am so confused that I missed some points in every quiz.",0,wi21
Every topics are interesting! No liked LEAST so far in this class.,0,wi21
I think doing a group project makes this class a little difficult because its hard to find time for the group to meet because everyone has very conflicting schedules. ,0,wi21
"Early lecture, not a morning person lol",0,wi21
"I honestly don't like that I have to work in a group of four, but at least I get more experience with collaboration :)",0,wi21
"Coding as always been hard for me and this class is no different, so as coding gets more complicated I have to spend more and more time on this class and it ends up being the most difficult and time consuming. ",0,wi21
"Everything is good, it's just hard to get up at 9 in the morning :)",0,wi21
Remote learning makes the group communication a little harder than usual.,0,wi21
It'd be great if we spent more time talking about python ,0,wi21
"Actually there is nothing I do not like, this course is great.",0,wi21
"The thing I liked LEAST about COGS 108 so far is learning about all the different things that can be done in pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. I'm overwhelmed by how many different things can be done and don't think I can remember everything we go over in lecture.",0,wi21
Plotting graphs is hard.,0,wi21
"The Discussion notebooks are sometimes confusing from the lack of instructions on the notebook itself, but through lectures and research they are doable.",0,wi21
I find the assignments to be a little challenging and could take some time to complete with no prior python knowledge.,0,wi21
The Discussion problems are sometimes unclear or cover material that has not yet been taught.,0,wi21
Sometimes I find the Discussion assignments and the actual assignments difficult to do and stressful and I feel like I do not have enough knowledge from the class lectures to be able to answer the questions.,0,wi21
"This is less of a dislike, and more of me being bad at the utilization of python, pandas and other imports. It has gotten easier (likely due to previous experience with java) though, so it is not that bad!",0,wi21
"What I like least is just that there's never a right or wrong answer in some instances. I guess this could be a good thing, but in some cases I find myself doing a lot of outside research to understand something new that I have to learn to apply.",0,wi21
"I am not a fan of coding and am a beginner Python learner, which do not go well together. I have had to look basically everything up for the Discussion and normal Assignments, so it has been sometimes very frustrating and time-consuming, even when I do go to office hours/section for help.",0,wi21
"The data visualization teaching portion could use some work. I really struggled with D3 on how to wrangle the data into a usable format to display. I attended lectures and you went over some of it but it was nowhere near enough for the discussion lab. I also attended two different TA's office hours but neither was able to help too much. They both seemed just as lost as I was with the errors I encountered and were unable to effectively guide me on alternate strategies. If the time spent teaching data-wrangling strategies was increased before dropping us into the lab or more guide rails were added to the lab to help us, that would make the experience much better as our support structure wasn't able to prop us up and google isn't particularly helpful as the error messages are very generic and nondescriptive of the true nature of the error.",0,wi21
Class is too early,0,wi21
"The least I've liked about COGS 108 is just realizing just how much memorization is required in cleaning, wrangling, and visualizing data. I'm not only trying to memorize the syntax for Python, but I'm also struggling with remembering what functions to call in pandas and how to correctly type out the operation I want. I spent 3 hours trying to google how to run just one cell and I still never figured it out. It is quite a lot to keep track of and I know the only way to get better is practice practice practice! No matter what though, I'm super excited to be learning these tools and it's great to know that this knowledge will be useful for me in the long run! 

Also, the quizzes are not my favorite. I have watched the lecture videos twice sometimes and I still cannot get full points on the quizzes.",0,wi21
Learning how to use Python,0,wi21
"Because I live in a different time zone and have a tight schedule for when I can watch friday lecture, it is difficult for me to apply things that are mentioned in friday lecture to my assignments/group project. It would be nice if most of the tips and advice could be concentrated into monday and wednesday lecture. But all in all it's been really great, this is very minute :)",0,wi21
"I'm still working on adjusting to GitHub since I haven't had prior experience with it, so having it as a vital part of the course is a little challenging.",0,wi21
"I don't really like the weakly quiz, although it's not really hard, but i still would miss 1 or 2 points on weekly quizzes",0,wi21
"I do not like the assignments, due to my difficulty with them on my own.",0,wi21
"The group project, this is because although I understand it is necessary of an experience for the future, it is still difficult to manage a project all online, while still trying to be understanding of other group-mate's personal situations and responsibilities.",0,wi21
I don't really like the weekly quizzes. I feel like they don't accurately assess what I have learned from that week.,0,wi21
It's difficult to learn and apply a lot of the topics we've learned in class to our projects due to the fast-paced nature of the class. ,0,wi21
Lecture talking speed a little too fast,0,wi21
The quizzes just seem like busywork. I think the assignments help my learning significantly more because actively doing something helps me learn better than taking quizzes.,0,wi21
I think the quizzes are pretty stressful for me each week even though I watches each lecture on time.,0,wi21
"Not a huge fan of the assignments, I feel like I know the gist of what I have to do but then I do it and it ends up being wrong! I think i'm just not that confident with python so was hoping for a little more guidance.",0,wi21
"I don't necessarily have anything that I like the least. I feel like I personally do a lot more googling in this class than I have had to in cogs 18. However, I believe it's because this class is less oriented in learning about code and more about doing actual data science. ",0,wi21
"Figuring out how to graph was pretty hard. I kept getting errors with the parameters in seaborn. For example, I would try to pass something into the column but it would be the wrong column so my graph would look weird. Once I did figure it out though, it was very nice to see but the steps before are very frustrating.",0,wi21
The coding. The prerequisite for this class is one python class (which I took) and I feel wholly unprepared for the material in this class.,0,wi21
"Dealing with the submission system on DataHub. I wish there were more confirmations/acknowledgement of my submission that would give me more confidence that my work has been submitted successfully, currently there is little user feedback.",0,wi21
Homework,0,wi21
"Honestly, I've got nothing for this! Thanks for a great quarter so far (:",0,wi21
The homework is a little overload.,0,wi21
the discussions can be hard and the quizzes as well. Sometimes lectures don't really explain concepts introduced in the assignments or discussions too well. There are a lot of assignments due each week.,0,wi21
"Nothing, I like everything about the class so far",0,wi21
Keep procrastinating watching lectures led to more to watch...,0,wi21
the bugs I run into while trying to code for the hmw and trying to figure those things out,0,wi21
"Mm, nothing much. Maybe do more backflips during lecture? I'm just kidding, I'm thoroughly enjoying this course. ",0,wi21
The office hour is hard to reach since I am at different time zone.,0,wi21
"I've gotten frustrated with myself a couple times with either an assignment or workbook, but I know that's just what comes with being new to a programming language",0,wi21

"Fixing technical errors with Jupyter notebooks and Github, git controls",0,wi21
"I still think that the ethics are a little bit boring, although they are important.",0,wi21
"I'm not sure if it's by design, but I feel like I don't know enough about how to use pandas, seaborn, etc., by the end of lectures, and end up spending a lot of time on discussion labs and assignments. (Maybe the lecture is for the theory and labs are for application?)",0,wi21
The coding aspect of this course is by far the hardest and most frustrating thing of this course.  ,0,wi21
"The thing I liked the least is doing Discussion labs and assignments. I know they are supposed to help me practice so that I can do better for my project, but I felt like what we need to do for the labs and assignment are much more harder/advanced than what we learned in class. I had a really hard time trying to figure out D3. I tried watching technical discussion recording, going to a technical discussion, and going to the project discussion (I was waiting in the waiting room but ended up leaving because of my other schedule), but I wasn't able to get enough help / get enough idea on how to do some parts of D3.",0,wi21
maybe the quiz,0,wi21
"The process of creating our project topic, it is so hard and our team spend so many time thinking our topic. ",0,wi21
"It's pretty fast paced and I haven't worked too much with Python before so it's a little difficult, but not unbearable. ",0,wi21
"Rather than being something I dislike, it is overwhelming having more than one technology (Pandas & Seaborn) but that's normal. It's a lot more self-study than I expected.",0,wi21
"Waking up at 9am, quizzes because I keep getting 1 or so questions wrong",0,wi21
"Much of the assignments feel like information I've been taught in previous classes such as basic pandas, but I understand that that is probably necessary for many students.",0,wi21
What I have liked least is the stuff to do with github because I am not familiar with it so it is still a little confusing. ,0,wi21
Finding the data for our project,0,wi21
"The discussion assignments, I often feel like they are harder than the actual assignments and it's hard to prioritize discussion assignments when they aren't mandatory/I don't have time in the week to work on it for a few hours",0,wi21

The assignment because it is kind of a lot and hard for me since I don't have much python experiences before.,0,wi21
Assignments,0,wi21
I don't like the discussion assignments. I have a really hard time trying to figure out how to do them even after office hours.,0,wi21
"I feel like the D# (D1, D2, etc) should be more basic/ tutorial style, because the only point of these are to teach and help understand rather than test knowledge (like the A# and Q# should). If the D# had more hints or more explicit about how to solve the problem, that would be extremely helpful. ",0,wi21
"As I am pretty unfamiliar with pandas, the discussions have been a bit harder for me, but this may also be due to the fact that I'm not able to access the discussion recordings.",0,wi21
"Although I enjoy making the visualizations, I don't have a strong foundation in python or programming skills, so it has been frustrating getting used to the syntax, processes and general logistics of it. ",0,wi21
The thing I liked the least is having to coordinate group times with everyone because it is a bit challenging to coordinate times virtually.,0,wi21
"The weight of each assignment and components of the project are stressful and overwhelming because they are worth a significant percent of my grade and unlike discussions and quizzes, it hard to be assured that I did it well and/or get quick feedback.",0,wi21

"I prefer piazza to CampusWire, but I am slowly getting the hang of it",0,wi21
trying to find a group ,0,wi21
I have not enjoyed the quizzes too much as I feel it would be better if we could earn back the points we lose in some way. This is due to some earlier quizzes having trickier questions but it is reasonable as the loss isn't too large. The quiz questions are fine as they do just ask largely about things one should know straight from lecture notes and recordings.,0,wi21
"I have disliked the fact that a lot of technical code related things are glossed over  even after having taken cogs 18 it really feels like this is a class meant for CS majors. Given that its a cogs major requirement, I think catering more to cogs majors makes sense. ",0,wi21

The different graph. ,0,wi21
The assignment deadlines are lining up with other class assignment deadlines but that is all. ,0,wi21
"The fact that we have to come up with the project proposal (which essentially also means already having a particular dataset, etc in mind preemptively) before we've learned much about the type of analysis we'll be doing.",0,wi21
I don't really understand lecture since it's usually large blocks of code and we go through them quickly rather than breaking down each code line. I also don't like how most of the topics in discussion lab are not in lecture and I feel like I have to google most of it to understand. ,0,wi21
"Learning these modules is real confusing... Like I understand a good amount of python, but I can't wrap my head around the data manipulations and plotting stuff. Still feel like I need a ton more help and it's making me very stressed about making progress on my project, since there's so much I want to do but I just can't because I don't know how to go about starting.",0,wi21
"Lecture can be a little dense/fast sometimes. Occasionally, professor will take time and carefully express how a certain function works and gives multiple examples of different uses; other times she breezes through a function and gives a general idea of how it works, this results in many students (at least the ones I have communicated with) investing a large sum of time figuring out how to use certain functions during each and every assignment so far.",0,wi21
Vaguely worded options in quizzes,0,wi21
"The materials are getting scarier by lecture. The amount of new stuff is a little overwhelming to me, especially when applying them in the discussion labs and upcoming assignments, as well as for the final project. I worry that my performance won't be as satisfactory as I'd hope. It's also extremely time consuming to me because of my limited knowledge, but whenever I get it it's the best feeling.",0,wi21
the coding aspect is a lil overwhelming ,0,wi21
Sometimes I feel like quiz material is not covered in the lectures or is very detailed so it's hard to remember. I take notes on majority of the content and sometimes I still can't recall/find it.,0,wi21
"Some of the discussion labs were very challenging for someone with essentially no experience with the analysis packages, also Assignment 2 was due after Lab 3, but lab 3 required skills learned from assignment 2 which was confusing.",0,wi21

"Assignment is too straight forward (solutions are almost given), maybe having weekly problem set without specific approach would better promote self-learning.",0,wi21
I think the least I like about this class is that there's a lot of coding but not too much detail on how to do it. I often find myself looking up how to use functions in order to complete the discussion labs and assignments. ,0,wi21

"Overall I really enjoy the class but what I think the thing I like the least has more to do with coding than it actually has to do with the class. I've taken a bunch of CS courses before this class but I think pandas in general just irritates me because I'm so unused to it. I understand how to solve the problems and what the end goal should be, but I find that it can be really annoying without knowing the right code to use along with not knowing what exactly to look up when I'm stuck.",0,wi21
Probably the discussions as they are sometimes ambiguous and I'm unsure of what to put in for my answers sometimes.,0,wi21
I have liked the least working with GitHub. This is more of a personal issue because it is my first time using it and I am very unfamiliar. I understand the terms and what I am supposed to do but get confused on how to carry out what I want to.,0,wi21
The lecture quizzes because at the end of the week I forget about the small details mentioned in class so I have to rewatch everything to pick up anything missing. ,0,wi21
The discussion quizzes. I feel like they are a bit harder than the HW,0,wi21
Difficult to get a hang of syntax etc for discussion assignments.,0,wi21
"I've liked the discussion labs the least, but that does not mean I don't enjoy them. I feel that they vary in difficulty too much and are quite unclear on what's exactly wanted, which makes them less enjoyable compared to the assignments. A suggestion from me would be to make the instructions slightly more clear on what's wanted, and I believe that will make the labs more enjoyable.",0,wi21
Discussions and Assignments are quite challenging. It would be beneficial for us to take more time learning programming rather than logics.,0,wi21
There's nothing I disliked about COGS108 thus far. The only thing I could nitpick would be that the assignment and labs can be a bit difficult at times if you don't show up to the lab sections. ,0,wi21
Homework is a little bit hard (datahub); still very worried about the final project since we think our proposal is not good and it is difficult to find data that we want and determine our research question,0,wi21
"If I had to pick, the part I've liked the least about COGS 108 was when we had to conceptually learn about github, privacy, ect. I like the coding aspect of this class more than the conceptual one so it was harder for me to focus on the concepts. On the other hand, I do recognize that they are important so I knew they were necessary to learn. ",0,wi21
The teach speaks a little too fast,0,wi21
"minimal instructions in discussions. I liked how A2 guides you and you learn a lot, whereas discussion is just less vague and you don't really know where to start if you're stuck.",0,wi21
"however, sometimes working with a group needs way more effort",0,wi21
"Not about the course but python itself, it was kinda confusing and hard to understand the logic at first since I have not learned it before this course, and it is pretty different from the languages I am familiar with (C++, java).",0,wi21
The incovinient caused by online courses make it difficult to communicate with group members.,0,wi21
There are some quiz problem that prof just mentioned ambiguously on class and I think it should be some more technical problem.,0,wi21
Not getting feedback for our project idea sooner.,0,wi21
Nothing. I am having a blast. Thank you,0,wi21
"I don't like waking up early in the morning for lecture, but I have to because I liked being in lecture live.",0,wi21
I want to learn more on how to use Github because I am still not comfortable using them.,0,wi21
"I definitely have struggled a little with the discussion labs - the assignments are fine because the instruction is detailed, but even after watching the discussions I can't figure a lot out. This is also the first very hands on course I've had at UCSD with doing my own research so it has been hard believing in myself and my abilities when it is something out of my comfort zone that I don't have experience with. But nonetheless I am very excited to get more involved in this class!",0,wi21
Groups,0,wi21
Lectures go a little fast.,0,wi21
"Knowing that COGS 108 was an intro to data science, I knew that we were going to be going really fast through some of the topics. I would love to have spent more time going over pandas syntax and tools and tips for effective data wrangling.",0,wi21
The consistent amount of assignments,0,wi21
"That it's at 9am! ;) On a serious note, there isn't anything I haven't liked about Cogs 108 so far",0,wi21
Working in groups. Very hard to coordinate meeting together. Not easy being productive on a large group project when being remote. ,0,wi21
I wish we had a midterm of sorts to synthesize the content so far,0,wi21
somehow I don't have any particular thing that I've liked the least,0,wi21
"The discussion labs, I feel like they just are a simplified version of assignments which don't necessarily add anything to my skillset",0,wi21
Discussion labs are a little bit harder than expected. I spent a lot of time on doing them.,0,wi21
The documentation for PANDAS sucks.,0,wi21
"So far the discussions take me significantly longer than the assignments. I wish I had learned all of the syntax that I need for discussions either in lecture or in a discussion guide, as most of the times I have to Google everything which takes a while depending on if I know what I'm looking for.",0,wi21
I have liked least about COGS108 assignments and discussion labs because most of them are not covered during the lectures. ,0,wi21
Mainly scared for finding datasets for our question and thinking that we should slightly modify our question based off this weeks lecture. I sorta think ours is a little vague and could be specified. ,0,wi21
The struggles and challenges of working as a team.,0,wi21
Nothing really course is not as high stress but more learning involved which is good. Maybe more lecture notes describing content in detail,0,wi21
"I don't like using many different platforms,  so campuswire is a bit annoying for me. I've never understood why we need canvas/piazza/campuswire/etc.",0,wi21
"Sometimes I feel lost in the immense data that is provided to us and I feel that I'm having a hard to honing down to a particular question that I want to solve (for the project) that at the same time, is also answerable with data.",0,wi21
"The assignments, I just take a long time completing assignments, but that's just because I struggle with coding.",0,wi21
"The discussion sections have gotten pretty long, but I like that we can check our answers after.",0,wi21
"I wish we could get more help through a system like autograder, but that might be a personal preference. ",0,wi21
Too many backgrounds and concerns on data analysis,0,wi21
I have liked everything in this course about equally so far. I find all the topic covered interesting and useful. I am not bored with anything. ,0,wi21
I personally do not like how much time I spend on the discussion assignments. I spend a lot of time trying to understand the question and then trying to solve it but its been very time consuming.,0,wi21
"The first few lectures were a bit slow for me, mainly because I already knew a lot of topics introduced at the start",0,wi21
Probably all of the time I spend debugging my code haha,0,wi21
I feel like lectures move a bit too fast. It's always one thing to the next without much explanation. Also discussion sessions I feel like a pretty useless,0,wi21
"Well, I'm not a great/well-versed coder so naturally, I don't like the coding part, but it's still fun to learn I just wish I had more time to absorb the information",0,wi21
I think it's pretty good,0,wi21
"I think figuring out as a team what to approach for our project was difficult. We had directions we were interesting in heading towards, but had to really figure out which ones would yield a significant enough perspective, which had data sets that could give us ample information, etc. I am excited to get rolling though now that we have our research question!",0,wi21
My least favorite part of COGS108 is the submitting process on datahub. I'm constantly forgotting to submit my assignments and have to revisit the page after I finish (assuming I remember),0,wi21
"Least of all - I don't really like weekly quizzes, but i understand why we need them",0,wi21
"I dislike that we have multiple things due every week. E.g. quiz, hw, discussion.",0,wi21
i like it,0,wi21
Hardest part about this class is learning command line to push and pull repo. ,0,wi21
Everything is very new and tough. Takes a lot of time to learn the concepts,0,wi21
"I like that all the deadlines are on the same day, but I do feel like it's a lot of work each week when balancing 3 other demanding classes too. ",0,wi21
Nothing in particular. The pace is a bit fast but I am learning a lot.,0,wi21
not knowing where the project is headed yet gives me some anxiety,0,wi21
completing the assignments and labs ,0,wi21
The vague expectation for the final project's group works.,0,wi21
Discovering A2 was basically a precursor to a lot of what I couldn't quite wrap my head around in D3.,0,wi21
"Sometimes it's hard to wake up for this class in the morning, so I can't always attend synchronously like I would prefer",0,wi21
The least I have liked about COGS108 is that its online and one doesn't necessarily get the help they need in person (which can be more clear). Overall I think this course has done great job in making up for that which is good. ,0,wi21
"Github, but that could just be that I might not still understand how to use it",0,wi21
I do not like the discussions too much because it is a little too open-ended and can sometimes be really difficult to answer some of the questions. D3 was one where it was very hard because I had to wait until Friday's lecture to do some of the questions more easily.,0,wi21
"Honestly, I don't find much of if non-enjoyable. ",0,wi21
"Using github to work on the project. Only because our group meets up over discord and works on it together, so github doesn't really facilitate all of us working on a document together. But I'm sure it'll be more useful as we make smaller changes to the document. ",0,wi21
The Lab Assignment is a little bit difficult sometimes.,0,wi21
im melting,0,wi21
What I liked least about COGS 108 is really nothing. I think this class is pretty well prepared during the online era of college. I enjoyed everything about this class so far.,0,wi21
The weekly quizzes. I've been going to all the lectures and I still struggle with them.,0,wi21
I find it hard to get other people in my group to work on a group project when our only form of communication is online. ,0,wi21
"Sometimes in the weekly discussions, the instructions are a little vague so I have to spend more time finding out exactly what I need to do or ask other people who to interpret the question.",0,wi21
The discussions because I have trouble usually with knowing the right way to solve them.,0,wi21
"Sometimes, the I feel like I don't have the appropriate knowledge to solve coding problems on the assignment and feel frustrated.",0,wi21
"I don't like working with my group. It's awkward, I try to talk to them but they're all hesitant to share their thoughts. So I unintentionally became the team lead in order to get things done. My teammates are still putting in the work though. Also I think that they don't attend lecture so they're unfamiliar with Github, etc. so more of editing the files fall onto me, which I'm okay with but it would be nice if the technical skills were more evenly dispersed in my group. ",0,wi21
"I don't have many complaints, but the assignments are frustrating at times as with any coding. ",0,wi21
I feel like the group work has been a lot less exciting than I was hoping for. This would be my first project class so maybe I just don't really have a very accurate expectation. ,0,wi21
"I don't feel that the Technical Discussion have been super helpful for the Discussion assignments. For D3, the TA/IA leading the section I went to just spent most of class walking through Babynames, so I didn't really get to ask any questions about D3.",0,wi21
"Occasionally one of the assignments will have a vague question and it's hard to tell if I answered it as was intended, or sometimes I've already done something in a workbook that I'm asked for later and I don't know whether to remove it from where I did it on my own first and move it there, make a note about it, etc. The workload is pretty heavy on a weekly basis compared to most of my other classes, but that's both a pro and a con for me since I do enjoy the material.",0,wi21
The documentation for various Python functions can be arcane.,0,wi21
"The group project is not as interesting as I thought, it was hard to find a good research question",0,wi21
"I don't like the quizzes system. I think it is probably because I am frustrated from missing one of the quizzes by accident and losing that part of the grade. I think the assignments are useful  and do a good job to make sure that students are on top of the material week by week, so I don't understand the purpose of the quiz.",0,wi21
"I Don't like how many of the lecture and learning materials are in different places, such as GitHub, Datahub, and Canvas",0,wi21
The syntax. Plus Ive been spending too long on discussions,0,wi21
"Lack of guidance in project - it's not clear which TA will be supervising our project or if we are on the general path for producing a 'good' project. I recognize this stance may be hasty in judgement, as we will be getting reponses to our Final Project Proposals soon.",0,wi21
What I have least liked about COGS 108 so far is mainly the group work. I do not mean to be mean but the work feels like its just a 1 week break and then do something for a half a day and then next week or next next week and i think that is fine but i forget a lot.,0,wi21
"The discussion assignments are confusing to me. I find it difficult to do the discussion assignments even after watching lectures and reviewing the discussion section video. I find that it takes up too much time to complete, and I could be focusing on other assignments that are due the same day such as the quiz or assignment/group project.",0,wi21
"Coordinating group project stuff because of having to resolve various schedule conflicts, especially since I have a job outside of school",0,wi21
The lab/DI work we do each week doesn't do much to aid learning as there is little guidance. Assignments seem to be better at this.,0,wi21
The discussion labs are sometimes challenging,0,wi21
There is nothing that I dislike :),0,wi21
"Really like the class, wish it was in person.",0,wi21
"I think that if the lectures were a little more geared towards the Discussion and the Assignments for this class, it would be ideal. I find myself a little confused on the wording of the questions within the worksheets and problems of the homework due at times, especially also the failure of assertions to work on problems (e.g. the 1950 until now question in Discussion 4) confuses me at times.",0,wi21
I least liked some of the difficult questions on the assignments that I couldn't fully grasp through past lecture information and having to rely on searching the web.,0,wi21
"It is alright at the moment, just feels like theres plenty to keep track of.",0,wi21
None. I'm certain that every lecture is very useful and meaningful. ,0,wi21
I feel python is a little bit challenging.,0,wi21
I dislike doing the quizzes. I wish the assignments and discussions would replace the quizzes.,0,wi21
"I think the Term Project could use a bit of more guidence, I feel like it is rarely talked about in class",0,wi21
dicussion,0,wi21
that groupby specific question in D3 cuz I couldn't figure it out,0,wi21
"Despite having background experience in Java, the discussion labs and assignments can still be a bit confusing. I think this is naturally me just trying to learn something new though.",0,wi21
"The Discussion assignments, feel much more tedious than need to be ",0,wi21
The assignments (mostly A2) have felt fairly dense and difficult to complete (however this may be due to my lack of experience with programming/data analysis).,0,wi21
"This will probably have to be my group. After 4 weeks, I feel like 2 of the group members are dead weight. Either they don't contribute or they write like minimal effort/thought sentences, which will require us to redo the sections for them. As a result, despite having 5 people, it's more like 3 individuals doing all the work. Furthermore, at least for me, I think even if they don't do anything, it's definitely harder to focus when you know that you're somewhat carrying other student who simply don't seem to care.",0,wi21
COGS108 is my favorite class this quarter. I really do not have much to complain at the moment. ,0,wi21
"What I've liked least is that the discussions feel really hard, while the homeworks feel pretty easy. I find myself lost often on the discussion.",0,wi21
"I mostly just dislike having to get up for class at 9am, but that's pretty much it. The coding is stressful, but it always is for is so it's nothing new.",0,wi21
Kind of wish there was more of a chance for interaction besides in our groups.,0,wi21
The note in jupytr notebook are sometimes hard to read. ,0,wi21
"I feel there're some functions of pandas and seaborn that i'm not familiar with, so i need to spend relatively longer time to learn in order to wrap them up and deal with discussion assignments. I also hope we could have more iclicker questions to practice.",0,wi21
"Occasionally, I feel as though the lectures utilize a few methods that could be a little more explained, especially for students (like me) who have minimal experience with Python - this particularly goes for Data Viz concepts. However, I understand this could be simply a lack of understanding on my part, but if we could somehow get a type of reference sheet with Data Viz functions and differences between packages, it'd be really helpful! ",0,wi21
I'm not sure if I dislike anything.,0,wi21
"There are some aspects of the code being used that has not been explained or brought up in lecture, and I many times find myself googling very simple things but with different websites giving me different definitions. Would be helpful if there was some standardized reference sheet for syntax.",0,wi21
The assignments. They can get very tedious and frustrating. It can become really difficult sometimes to understand why the code does not pass an assert or why it raises an error.,0,wi21
"I wish there were more optional readings/materials. More exposure would really help these topics ""settle"" for me!",0,wi21
The discussion assignments are much more difficult and pretty vague. ,0,wi21
"The different types of plots have been something that I have not been enjoying. I have worked with different plots before in a stats class, but interpreting and nailing the difference between each of the different types is something I'm not entirely used to yet.",0,wi21
The weekly quizzes. I feel like they are not helpful.,0,wi21
"I think the topics are really interesting, but I would like more of an emphasis on how to perform a data science project with regards to a data sci project in industry. I think the project could be more rigorous as I would like to be able to use this project  as an opportunity to promote my data science skills",0,wi21
So far I find the course very interesting and there isn't anything I particularly dislike.,0,wi21
Discussions (they are very hard),0,wi21
"The weekly quizzes, cause there is always 1 question that I can never be sure what the answer is cause I'm a little confused on the phrasing of the question or which answer is being desired, so it just slightly bothers me",0,wi21
I do not like the constant stressing over one question,0,wi21
"Although this cannot be avoided, the fast pace of utilizing python is my only ""complaint"". Coming from a person who had never coded in python before, it was difficult learning the basics and applying learnings from class. Another inevitable fact is that I need to take this course this quarter, which happened to be a very challenging time for both education and my mental health. Other than that, I cannot think of any legitimate complaints!",0,wi21
"I think technical contents aren't really covered in lectures, so it takes a lot more of our own research time to look up functions covered in the discussions. It would be a lot more helpful if lectures could cover at least some content for discussion as it could further reinforce our familiarity with functions that we would probably use in our final project.",0,wi21
"I think what I've liked least about COGS 108 so far is our group project. With the pandemic and varying time zones it is very difficult for all of us to convene at a  specific time, and because of that some members feel pressured to put in work before meetings than they have to. This results at an inherent imbalance in work distribution, which doesn't necessarily occur out of any malicious intent, but rather self preservation. ",0,wi21
Working on the group project - I do not enjoy working in groups.,0,wi21
"The adjustment to using python has been a bit of a struggle, as I am largely used to using java. Yet, this isn't a great deterrent to the course as it is a learning opportunity.",0,wi21
"coding and doing the projects.  process of writing codes are too struggling for me, and the topic the project of my group is hard for me to fully understand. Honest talk, Sorry..",0,wi21
Nothing really,0,wi21
All the office hour is kinda early in my time zone.,0,wi21
"My project group, which seems to have abandoned me",0,wi21
The process for figuring out the problems,0,wi21
"I don't learn a lot from the discussion sections, and it always feels like there's not enough time to cover everything. ",0,wi21
The discussion sections have been a bit vague for me and I often struggle with getting through it. ,0,wi21
The amount of coding :/,1,sp21
Learning the basics of python,1,sp21
The assignments are really helpful in practicing python skills,1,sp21
the professor's enthusiasm- it makes watching the lectures fun,1,sp21
the assignment and the lab; able to practice using python,1,sp21
"I enjoyed working on the datahub assignments, they give good practical skills",1,sp21
"What I've enjoyed the most about COGS 108 has been the overall subject matter. This is one of my first upper division courses, and just being able to work and learn about a subject which isn't something simply required or foundational for my other courses is very liberating.",1,sp21
I think the assignments and discussion labs helped me a lot in reviewing the content!,1,sp21
Learning to blend coding with research/analytical thinking.,1,sp21
Live Jupyter notebook demonstrations using interesting examples! Helps me learn in an interactive way.,1,sp21
Group Project which we have to work very hard with our teammates.,1,sp21
I enjoyed the lectures and the mini clicker questions on Zoom.,1,sp21
Learning how to use Pandas,1,sp21
utilizing functions learned from class to solve my assignments.,1,sp21
Weekly discussion practices! Plus the option to be walked through it because otherwise I'd spend many hours on them. It helps keep on top of the coding development throughout the quarter while lectures are very concept based and the code skimmed over is getting progressively more complicated.,1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the pacing of the lectures, and Professor Ellis's teaching style during the lectures.",1,sp21
I think I have enjoyed the labs the most as they provide the most insight regarding the course.,1,sp21
"I have enjoyed learning about data visualization and analysis so much because it can be so applicable to me in a research setting when trying to preprocessing data, visualizing the data, and analyzing the data with EDA. I also like the consistent checkups on our group projects.",1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the project component of COGS 108 the most so far. Thinking of a meaningful research question and then planning out how I and my group would go about answering that question is something I find rewarding. I've wanted to conduct independent investigations of data for a while now, but lacking a structured way to do it has partly held me back. Thankfully, I've been able to leverage some of the COGS 108 material about drafting a research question to achieve this goal.",1,sp21
I enjoyed meeting with my groups. Gives me a chance to talk to others since with covid it gets pretty hard to meet new people,1,sp21
I enjoy the lecture contents. I enjoy learning about GitHub as I am much more comfortable with it now compared to the beginning of the class.,1,sp21
"This is my first data science class so all these new concepts are very interesting to me. I like how all duedates are on friday, which makes it super easy to remember what I have to do for this class. All the resources on Github repo and the templates for our final project are also very helpful. Since it is a big project, its nice that we have a lot of guidance and resources to go for help",1,sp21
I enjoy learning how to read the data and draw conclusions using python and pandas.,1,sp21
Being able to better learn how to create visualizations using data from CSV files,1,sp21
I have enjoyed the assignments the most so far because they are a great way to use the skills we learn in class in an applicable setting.,1,sp21
Seeing how there's coding behind data analysis and that there is code out there that does most of the work for us,1,sp21
Using example data to analyze in class to demonstrate concepts and practices. It really helps me understand how and why we are doing certain things with the data,1,sp21
"How to identify the ethic on the the problem and data set we picked, I enjoyed this the most is because it answered the question I had for a long time.",1,sp21
"I wanted to learn Pandas for a long time, and learning it in this class is great.",1,sp21
"I have enjoyed learning about pandas the most. I understand its usefulness and appeal to SWE recruiters, and thus I am grateful that I have been able to learn a bit of it.",1,sp21
I really enjoying working on the coding labs and assignments! pandas is super cool to use and I'm happy I am starting to become more familiar with the methods used. I find it super fun especially compared to my work from other classes.,1,sp21
The lectures are engaging and interesting; definitely one of my more enjoyable classes.,1,sp21
how helpful the TAs have been with the lab assignments. I get lost a lot so having their help is amazing.,1,sp21
The fact that it is project based and that the main assignment due dates are each two weeks a part from each other. This makes it way easier to balance this class with my other classes and not feel rushed in my work.,1,sp21
"The discussions since they are really hands on, and if I get stuck I can refer to the technical discussion, so they are fun!",1,sp21
The satisfaction of finally figuring out code that works! This is the best feeling,1,sp21
"First class back programming in years after my hiatus, so it has been interesting attempting to crash course some python while not having extremely difficult coding problems, and instead using it in more practical situations. Plus this is my first real data related class which is what I eventually would like to end up doing so it is exciting (aside from the pressures of school/life).",1,sp21
"I guess the organization of this class, this has been the best class i had during remote learning in terms of structure. I LOVE that the due dates are all on friday ranging from quizzes, labs, hw, and project stuff. It keeps me organized since I've been using my planner more this quarter.",1,sp21
"Maybe the lecture, because data science is new to me, and I feel I learned a lot in every lecture.",1,sp21
The technical discussions are really helpful for me to complete the discussion assignments.,1,sp21
"Discussion assignments, very helpful when doing Assignments",1,sp21
Learning hands on skills!,1,sp21
"I enjoy the lectures; they're very straightforward and easy to understand, and I'm learning new things every time!",1,sp21
"The step-by-step Jupyter notebook assignments (i.e., discussion lab + assignments). The Jupyter notebooks are extremely helpful for teaching me how to code in a step-by-step, *explained* process. I really like this format compared to previous coding classes.",1,sp21
"So far, I've enjoyed learning the programming from this class",1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the group work aspect of COGS108. I love working with my group over an extended period of time to work towards a goal that we all share. Moreover, collaboration on a scale this big is sometime that's new to me, as this is the first class that I've worked on a project with group members.",1,sp21
Groupwork! Especially in pandemic with no one to talk to. And TA's technical hours are super helpful!!!,1,sp21
I liked how the class is set up so you do not fall behind especially with the project,1,sp21
"The first things that come to mind are the structure of the lectures and the assignments. For the lectures, I enjoy that we have corresponding Jupyter notebooks that we can follow along with. Also, the regular clicker questions keep us engaged in the lecture and encourage us to think about the concepts we cover.

I like that all assignments and labs are guided: we aren't just told to do something. We are given some level of hints and direction, and we have asserts to check our code. I think this is very important since many of us are new to this area. This approach ensures that we still must apply what we have learned (and also gives us practice using API references), while minimizing frustration and the likelihood of becoming stuck and unable to complete the assignments.",1,sp21
"I really enjoyed the neat little tricks that this class teaches using the different python libraries. It's refreshing to have a class where students are taught how to use libraries to their advantage (like in the labs) and I think it's really applicable to the future, even if you don't major in cs or data science.",1,sp21
The visualization aspect,1,sp21
I enjoy the hands-on experience we are getting in regards to the general direction a data science project should go.,1,sp21
Jupyter assignments have been informative,1,sp21
The overarching review of the process of data science is very clarifying.,1,sp21
"I think the instructions are much clearer than most other coding classes I've taken here and at UC Merced, not saying those were bad - but I really appreciate the organization of the class and the ease of access to resources for help.",1,sp21
Coding,1,sp21
I got used to Python and Pandas.,1,sp21
Revisit Pandas,1,sp21
Revisit Pandas,1,sp21
I enjoyed writing assignments as I think they are good practices.,1,sp21
"How to use python to coding and analyze data,",1,sp21
technical discussion really helps to explain coding parts,1,sp21
I enjoy working on the project a lot. I found a wonderful group whose members I wouldnt have known otherwise if not for the class!,1,sp21
"I like the interactive Lectures, working with the Juypter Notebook together is a great way to learn",1,sp21
"Working on the research project, the topic is super interesting and its good practice using Pandas",1,sp21
The lectures and working through python,1,sp21
I love the way professor ellis answers all of our questions genuinely without making people feel like they were silly and the examples used to demonstrate the concepts we learn. Both of these have made learning coding and data science much less intimidating and more fun to learn!,1,sp21
I have enjoyed lecture and my groupmates the most so far. Prof Ellis does a really good job at keeping information interesting and engaging and she makes it easy to ask questions. Most of my groupmates are easygoing and fun to talk to so it is fun to meet with them.,1,sp21
The discussion assignments,1,sp21
"Learning how to apply principles of data science (wrangling > cleaning > testing) to data gathered in the ""real world"" rather than just crafted sets handed to us.",1,sp21
Learning new tools to explore and visualize data because it will help me with future projects.,1,sp21
Talking with my group members,1,sp21
I really like messing around and using git and github. Its new and refreshing for a COGS class.,1,sp21
The labs because they are very helpful in understanding how to apply what we have been learning,1,sp21
"Professor's clearly invested in her students and wants them to learn. Most helpful part is the discussion assignments, I feel like I'm actually learning by doing vs just listening to lecture.",1,sp21
I have found the labs and assignments to be quite enjoyable. The datasets are interesting and the manipulations we are doing on them/the visualizations we have been creating thus far are fun and a good way to learn.,1,sp21

"I really enjoy how much help we are able to get every week. Additionally, I feel as though the labs and the assignments have helped me get a better grasp on the material. I am able to understand the code a lot more when I'm required to use it in the labs and the assignments. I also enjoy Professor Ellis' teaching. It's been pretty engaging so far, the quizzes are fair, and I feel like she's been very reasonable and understanding when it comes to the course and students' varying abilities.",1,sp21
"So far in COGS 108, the part that I enjoy the most are the various case studies and examples that are presented in lecture. I feel like they display examples of how the skills we learn in class can be applied to a wide variety of situations.",1,sp21
The structure of the class is nice and allows me to be flexible. I really enjoy how open ended the project is going to be (hopefully).,1,sp21
I think the content of this course is pretty useful especially for those who had no idea about the data science. TAs are very active and responded my question every time.,1,sp21

"I enjoy the lecture format, I think the organization and pacing is perfect. The data we analyze is interesting as well.",1,sp21
The lectures are fairly helpful and Prof Ellis is good at explaining things for people who aren't familiar with data science,1,sp21
"What i have enjoyed most about COGS 108 is the weekly quizzes that we have, it helps to stay on track with what's going on in class. I think making the final project as group project is helpful to divide work amongst people and not just for one person so it won't seem like a giant workload.",1,sp21
I've enjoyed the assignments a lot actually! I originally really struggled with coding and it's nice to see that my hard work is paying off and the mistakes I'm making are small and not understanding errors,1,sp21
"COGS 108 helps me to know more about data science since this is my first data science course in UCSD. It helps me to know more about the ethical responsibility of being a data scientist and bringing a good question in the beginning is important as well as find a best model to analysis the data. I enjoyed all the real topic around our life or the possible solution we could use data science to find answer for and make peoples life better. However, I feel like it is hard to get a 100% authentic database when it comes to the personal information or opinion. But some of the severe social problem need peoples opinion on it so that we can make change to it. It is hard to make adjustment when the analysis based on the data of biased reality.",1,sp21
having examples in labs so we can learn through it and not have to google everything for 3 hrs,1,sp21
"simplicity, all the assignments are straightforward, and I'm actually learning what all the buzz words that popped up in my courses mean.",1,sp21

I think the lectures are very interesting and keep me engaged.,1,sp21
"I enjoyed most of the demonstrations used with Python. I am able to learn the basics of exploratory data analysis, and being able to do weekly assignments makes the workload doable each week, instead of very few big assignments. The checkpoints for the group project is also helpful to keep us on track.",1,sp21
"I think the lectures are paced well at a speed that always keeps my attention, and I like the numerous examples we go over in class. I also like how the examples involve topics that are understandable and relatable to what I would know as a college student.",1,sp21
This class is a great refresher for reading statistics and review terms. I also enjoy working with my teammates on the project. There is no stress about the midterms.,1,sp21
enjoy to work with my group,1,sp21
The thing I have enjoyed the most about the class is the discussion labs. I feel like they are a good way for me to experiment with concepts we learn in class without having to worry about missing any points.,1,sp21

I am not the strongest coder but everything new that's used is thoroughly explained and given use case examples and walk throughs. I also like that how the uses and analysis of data are related back to real world examples. The technical discussion are also v helpful to me, S/O to the IAs! :-)",1,sp21
Doing my group project. I really like the people I work with and it's fun to think through the challenges we are facing.,1,sp21
"I like learning about data ethics and privacy, and its importance! I also have enjoyed the lectures since they are pretty interesting, and technical but also applicable to real life.",1,sp21
I like the talk about data science ethics,1,sp21
I like Professor Ellis's energy during lecture and how she explains the topics. She makes the class enjoyable to learn.,1,sp21
Challenging myself to learn the content and not getting frustrated with myself because I have barely any coding experience and I find it quite hard.,1,sp21
I liked learning about how we can actually use the knowledge we learned so far and putting it into a real world project. I've also liked learning about what data ethics is and what is the proper way to use datasets we find.,1,sp21
I enjoyed learning about different python packages to make visual aids and graphs.,1,sp21
I enjoy the assignments only cuz they challenge me to use my limited coding knowledge and solve problems that we have been studying in the past.,1,sp21
The lectures and the labs/assignments. I really enjoy learning and improving my ability to code. I think the lectures have been very entertaining and have been a nice way to start my morning. They cover a variety of data science topics and are enjoyable to listen to. I also am enjoying the labs and assignments because they are allowing me to apply the concepts I've learned in class.,1,sp21
"Professor And TAs are all great and happy to answer all our questions, which makes me feel safe to make mistakes. lol~",1,sp21
Everything is really structured. I like how every week we learn more that we then work on for our final project to slowly get closer to answering the research question. The discussion labs and technical discussions are really useful to understand the application of what we learn.,1,sp21
Professor's teaching style and engagement with students.,1,sp21
"I am taking a statistics class right now, so seeing some applications and common concepts in this class has been neat. It really helps me learn in both classes.",1,sp21
"So far, I've enjoyed working on the group project which has really, given us the chance to collaborate as well as, interact with other students in this class, especially when everything is virtual and I miss the classroom interaction. I also like the fact that all the submissions are well spaced out to give us a good amount of time to complete things.",1,sp21
learning more about pandas and dataframes specifically. I know theyre very useful and efficient. Ive used them for other courses before so its always nice to learn more cool things that can be done with them.,1,sp21
"Doing the assignments on datahub, I really enjoy the hands-on practice based on the course material. I feel like this format allows me to learn quickly and a wide range of new material.",1,sp21
We have weekly meeting and I've enjoined working and discussing with my team mates.,1,sp21
I think the demonstrations in class using jupyter notebook were interesting and caught my attention.,1,sp21
The discussion labs are helpful for assignments and our project.,1,sp21
I've enjoyed getting a chance to code and see statistics come to life through graphs generated in the jupyter notebook assignments. This is my only programming class this quarter so it's nice to be able to code still.,1,sp21
"I enjoy learning digestable chunks of information (in this case learning data science). I really enjoy how you structured the class and while there is a lot to take in, it's not overwhelming! I really enjoyed learning data science so far and if I had known about it sooner I might've delved more into it!",1,sp21
Love that the material doesn't go by so fast that it's hard to understand what's happening. The assignments aren't super time consuming - takes only a few hours at best. Unlike my cse classes that have assignments that take 10-20 hours a week...,1,sp21
"I learn a lot about how to use sns , pandas, matplot",1,sp21
"Lectures are extremely well taught - I'm a novice coder but it's been very easy to follow along and understand the skills that are being taught. Prof Ellis never condescends to us for not being experts - she explains things well and answers ALL questions, no matter how simple. As someone coming in from the engineering department, that attitude is much appreciated!",1,sp21
"I really like how Professor Shannon makes high-quality slides and explain everything very clearly. On top of all, the assignment has been very helpful.",1,sp21
Professor keeps lectures very entertaining!,1,sp21
I appreciate how well-structured and laid out the course is and learning some new tools like Jupyter and using pandas. Lectures are also engaging and I enjoy the bird songs in the background. I also appreciate how Prof Ellis is very receptive to student input.,1,sp21
The lectures are more entertaining than most other classes to actually attend.,1,sp21
The lectures are stimulating and are friendly to people just entering the world of data science.,1,sp21
The group project emphasis,1,sp21
The ability to get in contact with the professor and ta's,1,sp21
straughtforwardness,1,sp21
"I've enjoyed learning about the different ways we can visualize data and deciding on which visualizations are most appropriate given our data sets. I think this information will be very helpful for not only this project, but also the data science project I'm also working on for COGS 109.",1,sp21
"I really liked the lecture and how we go through each code in class. Professor Ellis managed to convey information clearly, making it very easy to understand.",1,sp21
"I have most enjoyed getting to meet new friends, who are now in my group! My favorite technical part of the class is getting to understand how to use incredibly powerful tools like pandas and seaborn.",1,sp21
Learning how to do visualizations is fun because it's cool to be able to quickly see data in many ways.,1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the labs and assignments because they are interactive in the sense that I'm writing code and am able to see visualizations of how my data is being formatted / being graphed. I've also enjoyed the lectures a lot because of the surveys through the class period. These surveys keep me engaged throughout class time, are a lot of fun and overall a great idea to do for remote learning.",1,sp21
"Discussion Lab, enjoy learning new skills",1,sp21
"Data cleaning, it was very relaxing",1,sp21
"Data cleaning, I find it super satisfying to grab data and eliminate the garbage while formatting it into such a clean, tidy format. Once it's printed out, it's satisfying to see the perfect shape and all the data values being relevant to the question of interest.",1,sp21
"The practicality of learning certain python tools instead of focusing too much on theory like in other classes. Also the organization of the course is very good, by keeping material relevant to the final project makes it easier on the students",1,sp21
Learning about how to analyze data properly,1,sp21
"Projected-based approach, super helpful technical discussion sessions",1,sp21
Challenging myself to learn the content and not getting frustrated with myself because I have barely any coding experience and I find it quite hard.,1,sp21
Lectures,1,sp21
Sections are very helpful,1,sp21
"I enjoy learning about Pandas and using it. I think it is hard for me to learn programming, like trying to understand what I can even do with pandas and use it on actual data.",1,sp21
Learning data science and statistics has been interesting and fun. The group project has been a great way to get hands-on experience with the subject.,1,sp21
Lectures,1,sp21
I enjoy the lectures and the layout and how it's very easy to follow.,1,sp21
"API and web scraping.
It is very useful to get information I want on the Internet.",1,sp21
"I love the professor. She is so fun and sweet and understanding. Literal breathe of fresh air. Though it is super early in the morning, I find her voice so soothing. The TA's are super amazing too, and I feel this class teaches a lot while also not being overwhelming.",1,sp21
"Just the overall data science on how it is used, what is used for, etc.",1,sp21
"I enjoyed being able to apply python learning into data visualizations. I have little experience in python, but I like that I am able to see practical use in coding throughout this class. I also enjoy working on a group project and being able to test our own research question/hypothesis, and also study and analyze data that we find on our own.",1,sp21
I've enjoyed learning in the discussion labs about how to analyze data at a coding level. It is sometimes simple coding but also very efficient and beneficial when analyzing data.,1,sp21
"This was my first class that worked with data this way, and with such a hands on experience with working with datasets of our choosing. It has been great learning about the different tools that pandas provides and really being able to understand and use them.",1,sp21
"The data analysis that is explained in class, because it has really helped me learn more about data science and practices within the field.",1,sp21
I've enjoined learning Python. Feel like I'm getting a good grasp of the syntax and becomign comfortable w/ the language.,1,sp21
The ability to slow down your lectures and use git for my other classes now is pretty cool.,1,sp21
The assignments because it is a fun and challenging assignment,1,sp21
Learning practical skills about data analysis,1,sp21
I think the class is structured really well around questions that are interesting and relevant to our society today. This contextualization is great because I think I take in information better when I can see (and actually take) the next step in applying the material learned in class.,1,sp21
I've really enjoyed the hands on practice we do with the content we are learning in class.,1,sp21
I like all the discussion datahubs because they help us go over material covered in class.,1,sp21
"The project is actually fun, we're trying to find some data on Bitcoin and Dogecoin which I am very interested in.",1,sp21
Working on the asssignments is very helpful and so is the professor,1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the practical aspect of using real life data to answer questions. In particular, I found the example involving analyzing sentiment from song lyrics quite interesting.",1,sp21
i have enjoyed the vibes and explanation style. very comforting.,1,sp21
Not much at the moment but I do like the teaching skills professor.,1,sp21
Discussion lab videos - lectures are clear - Assignments are not too bad - Working on the final project has been a little fun,1,sp21
I enjoy learning about Python and how to use it for my career. It helps me prepare for future work.,1,sp21
Utilizing real world tools that I might use when I enter the workforce - e.g. pandas/matplotlib/maybe seaborn,1,sp21
"I think pandas is really useful, and the discussion of ethical issues was interesting.",1,sp21
Working on the group project -- getting to actually find data and perform data science related manipulations on it has been really interesting and fun.,1,sp21
I've enjoyed meeting the people who are in my project group and having people to go to for help.,1,sp21
"I absolutely love the overall application of Data science to general problems while still dealing with the important/difficult topics in the discipline! I had a huge issue with one of my CSS classes that didn't really account for different styles of learning/levels of ability, and it was an absolutely trainwreck for me that I barely survived. This one is great because there's so many ways to understand a concept and I love seeing it briefly in code! (The last class only had the TA code).",1,sp21
I really enjoy in-class polls and example data sets in notes. Interesting data makes me pay attention a lot better and in-person polls are helpful in testing my knowledge of the notes!,1,sp21
Improving knowledge in python coding,1,sp21
The assignment. I can apply what I have learnt and solve problems.,1,sp21
Python was easier to grasp than expected.,1,sp21
Learning how to work with data,1,sp21
It challenges me and I usually like a challenge.,1,sp21
"Lectures are very clear, informative and just straight to the point. Prof. Ellis explains every concept very effectively, no time is wasted.",1,sp21
The fact that the final project is all about being as creative as possible and having the chance to get your hands dirty on the topic of your interest.,1,sp21
How beginner friendly and concise the material is.,1,sp21
"lecture and lab part, clear and understandable",1,sp21
"I've really enjoyed learning something I've never been exposed to before, data science itself. There's definitely a learning curve of some of the more complex topics in the class, but I think it's neat how we can break down and manipulate data into more digestible formats.",1,sp21
"I really enjoy applying the skills I learned to real data and datasets, i.e. working on the project. In other classes, we learn skills but apply them to a carefully designed assignment. However, in this class we have the opportunity to apply these skills to a project with real world data and that can be really messy and definitely not ideal, but learning to handle that mess is essential to working with data in the real world.",1,sp21
"The lecture topics are pretty interesting, and the fact that you answer everyone's questions makes the learning easier. I like how you're a very compassionate and understanding professor.",1,sp21
Learning about Explorative Data Analysis,1,sp21
"I've enjoyed the hands on approach that we have been taking in our assignments and discussion labs. There's nothing wrong with theory, but it's nice to be able to apply our learning into something meaningful.",1,sp21
"I love the content in the lecture, the kindness that the professor extends to us, and working on my project.",1,sp21
"I really like the discussion labs so far, because they give a hands-on approach to the functionality of libraries.",1,sp21
Data analysis using python,1,sp21
I've quite enjoyed the labs and learned a lot of python as well as a bunch of data cleaning tricks at an approachable pace.,1,sp21
Lots of things to keep up with every week.,0,sp21
Going a little bit slow for students with prior experience,0,sp21
"The weekly quizzes- sometimes, they are vague and misleading",0,sp21
project,0,sp21
Not sure,0,sp21
"Having to deal with learning the syntax and commands used in pandas, seaborn, matplot, etc. was never going to be fun. Translating ideas into code can be pretty frustrating, especially when I'm dealing with a new language I never used before.",0,sp21
I find it a bit difficult to find the information I need since there are a lot of github repos.,0,sp21
I am a little uneasy doing a somewhat unguided/open-ended project. I feel like I have to figure out what is expected and what I should do which I understand is part of the process but it is unsettling nonetheless.,0,sp21
Possibly need more guidance on the project in terms of data wrangling and extraction.,0,sp21
Too much code but this is what this course is for.,0,sp21
Some of the assignments take a bit longer than expected.,0,sp21
"If someone procrastinates, there can be a LOT to do on Fridays.",0,sp21
The weekly discussion labs are a little hard if there is no TA explaining it in the discussion session.,0,sp21
Long wait time for feedback from Project Proposal. My team is kind of halting our discussions until we hear back in case we get criticism and will need to change topic/planned data/approach,0,sp21
"The discussion labs are helpful, but it still feels like (for me at least) that there's a huge learning curve between doing discussion and the assignments. I've been having a really tough time nailing the syntax of seaborn and pandas, and whenever I ask my groupmates for help and figure out the answer, I wonder why the answer looks so obvious and I wasn't able to get it.",0,sp21
"The quizzes. They provide a lot of stress. If they were multiple attempts with nonmuted scores, i feel like i would retain most of the information regarding past lectures.",0,sp21
Can't think of anything at the moment,0,sp21
There isn't anything I dislike about COGS 108 so far.,0,sp21
I least like the discussion assignments just because it can get somewhat difficult for me.,0,sp21
The group project is a little stressful because I feel there's a lot of uncertainty at this stage.,0,sp21
"I think working in groups have gotten harder online because some people have a great ability to slack off more, so I think my least favorite part is my group dynamics.",0,sp21
The assignment seem a little redundant as there are already weekly quizzes and discussions and their varied due dates make it less easy to remember what weeks an assignment is due or not.,0,sp21
"Not being able to work on the project as much as I would like to, due mostly to other class requirements.",0,sp21
"I have liked least the weekly quizzes, but I understand why we need to have them.",0,sp21
Sometimes it is hard to get the basic codes for doing things and the examples are too complicated to replicate in practice. I also can never do the discussion assignment without going to the technical discussion session to get guidance.,0,sp21
"It's sometimes hard for me to get an intuitive understanding of certain practices in class without the theoretical discussion, for example, when doing linear regression on log transformed data, why is dividing by 100 a good idea for understanding to relationship of the data without the log transformation.",0,sp21
"I wish there are more information shared about past project, as it takes a long time for us to figure out what we wanted to do for the project.",0,sp21
"I don't like using sns, but I guess it's fine because the graph won't look too wield even if we do it wrong in sns.",0,sp21
"I have not liked how much work this class is giving out. Truthfully, I expected there to be less work with more time being devoted to finishing a good final project, but I am juggling working on assignments, discussion labs, and the final project for this class. This is all on top of the weekly quizzes. However, I do not think that the class should be giving out any less work because then the students would not be prepared enough to work on the final project properly.",0,sp21
"I think the group work aspect and agreeing on datasets we all want to use was not fun. It was kind of difficult making sure that our question was doable based on what data we were able to find (we know we weren't supposed to do this, but it did help us stay realistic with what we wanted to research)",0,sp21
"It's a bit challenging learning pandas sometimes, since documentation can be overwhelming with all the technicalities.",0,sp21
"Nothing yet, everything has been good, but I do get lost at times with the coding.",0,sp21
Nothing! everythings great,0,sp21
"The group project stuff, just because nothing is set in stone.",0,sp21
"The group project, working in groups during the pandemic has been a struggle for me, it adds to the zoom fatigue.",0,sp21
"I don't love the project idea as much as I thought I did a week ago, although that's not specifically a COGS 108 issue. Once I'm into it a little deeper I think it will help me. Lectures are a little fast possibly, feels like it is hard to really retain all of the information even with the discussion labs. That could stem from my lack of python/programming familiarity though.",0,sp21
nothing that sticks out to me,0,sp21
"Maybe the quizzes. Since I am a novice on data science, I need a long time to digest the course content, and the time limit of quiz is a bit tight to complete all the questions. I hope we can get more attempts on quizzes to correct our mistakes, and I also hope the answers will be released immediately after we complete it.",0,sp21
The Friday dues are kind of weird. My other dues are all on weekends so sometimes I may mix up the due day for this class with my other classes (like for week 5's weekly project survey).,0,sp21
Nothing,0,sp21
Nothing in particular. I'm just waiting to delve deeper into the project at this point.,0,sp21
I think what I've liked least is the discussion labs because we already have homework assignments,0,sp21
"I haven't enjoyed the quizzes (obviously), but more importantly, the smaller random errors/bugs that are occurring in Jupyter Notebook (especially for the most recent lab).",0,sp21
N/A,0,sp21
I think going over some of the discussion lab in class,0,sp21
"My least favorite part of the class has been dealing with the group dynamic. There is often poor communication and a feeling of ""not being on the same page."" The project is the most significant part of the class, and dealing with uncertainty makes the project even more stressful. Of course, group-related concerns aren't something specific to this class.

I am quite intimidated and worried that the lack of knowledge and comfortability in using Python will make this class and project much more difficult.",0,sp21
"So far in COGS 108, the part that I have liked the least is that all of the deadlines are bundled together on Friday, which can sometimes make it feel a bit overwhelming on Fridays, when combined with other coursework.

I know all groups are required to have 3-5 people, so we are given a little more wiggle room so decide on how many there will be in the group. However, I think this requirement should go down to 3-4 people. Coordinating and working on the same document with 5 people has proven difficult.

The group project. It's a really great way to utilize the skills we're learning but my group members are not meshing and it's hard to work with a group that I feel I'm not connecting with. Not a class issue though!,0,sp21
"For project, database searching is hard to find with large enough sample and relative reference when it relates to the cold feet science topic. It is hard to navigate the project and understand what we really need for our project especially it is my first project. My group members are data science major with a lot of experience working on the Machine learning. I feel pressure that I need more work to catch up on them. 
For quiz, some questions are tricky like it is a multiply choice with only one right answer but the select choice buttons are like there are more than one correct choice. Also, there are always one or two abstract questions per quiz and I couldnt get it right even though I was in lecture every time. Language barrier  hurts a lot since sometimes I may dont understand some analogy in the lecture that I could infer to some hidden meaning. Ouch. Thanks for this extra credit. 
For assignment, I feel like that some features of the function is vague or how to use the plotting or understand the method of applying those functions need more tutorials.

"The project and (to a different extent) the lectures. The project is really cool but group projects are simply painful in asynchronous learning. There isn't enough substance or consistency and even with a good group (I like my group) it's hard to communicate. I like the concept of the project but even if it was executed perfectly (it's executed very well) it would still be my least favorite part because of the current nature of learning. I understand the transition from solo projects - it was too much work for each individual. But in some ways I think I might have enjoyed that. I enjoyed working on exploratory data analysis on my own in COGS 18. Regarding the lecture, it feels very educationally ""qualitative"" and not very ""quantitative."" I really enjoy the lecture but I feel like I'm not actually learning anything of substance. We jump around from topic to topic very quickly, and a lot of what we learn doesn't feel super applicable because it's very surface level. I don't want to see this class made harder, but I will say that I took COGS 109 over the summer and it was a joke. Perhaps 108 should be split into a sequence like 107a/b, and the subjects made more specific. 109 could even be replaced with the statistical/machine learning portions of 108.",0,sp21

Like usually on Fridays we have 3 assignments, quiz, discussion lab, project stuff/assignment. It requires us to stay on top of our stuff which can be hard at UC since it's quarter system and we often fall behind. I also have other class stuff due Friday (often math quizzes) and it's been hard managing all these because I need to get decent grades still.",0,sp21

As my group makes some changes to the project proposal based on the feedback, the score should be more reflective of our ""updated proposal"". I think that if this is not doable due to grading purpose, I hope that for the future class, there can be two grading of project proposal. First grading would weight 50%, and second grading of the revised proposal would weight the rest 50%. This way it also encourages students to learn from the feedback and make a better proposal.",0,sp21

"My least favorite part of COGS 108 has been the process of learning pandas. Although I have experience programming, pandas has been slightly annoying to learn since it seems like there are many different ways to do the same simple thing. It also sometimes seems like it takes many methods to do something that seems like it should be very simple and possible with one method. However, the notes and discussion labs have definitely helped along with the pandas documentation.

The ""topics"" don't necessarily need to be specific things, but I think that giving broad ""verticals"" that students can look over beforehand (as opposed to just the previous project review) would be a little helpful, especially since agreeing on a topic that has no ""bounds"" with 4-5 members can be difficult. Again, the current setup of the class is okay, but this is just something I felt would be helpful to some students.",0,sp21
