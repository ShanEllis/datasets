My least favorite part of the class has been finding a time to schedule meetings between all my teammates for the final project.,0
Being put into a group with random people.,0
The discussion is not useful enough....,0
The group project is a little intimidating since its so open ended and I am used to more structured projects that walk you through each step (i.e. COGS 120).,0
"The EDA lectures. I like them, but I do not feel like we need to have two of them. I would have liked that time to go towards other topics of data science, or so that we can have topics like runtime or efficiency within data science, since I feel like that would be extremely helpful for our projects (especially if we were to deal with extremely large datasets). I would also have liked to possibly expanded more on missing data and how to deal with that. The third assignment deals with Beautiful Soup and web scraping a bit, but I feel like it wasn't covered as much as it should have. Overall, part of the compromise of teaching such a breadth of material limits the depth we go into, but I still feel like some areas should be covered more (pandas, numpy, efficency, etc.) ",0
I like to discuss some cool idea when I meet with my group.,0
lecture to be more on program implementation,0
"I don't know if I'm getting much out of lectures because while I understand that there are conceptual issues to talk about, I wish they could also be more reflected in our homework. The homework and lectures feel very disconnected because I'm mostly googling for homework and even if I miss a lecture, it doesn't feel like I actually missed much. I also wish there were more points available in the class as its stressful that every point is a whole percent. ",0
assigned groups because I was looking forward to working with my friends,0
none,0
Nothing,0
I don't like the assignments because a lot of the questions aren't explicitly covered in lecture.,0
"I wish there were more structure to the final project. I liked how in COGS 9, there were assignments to make sure we keep up, and I feel like my group is behind in the project already.",0

nothing,0
Having to google so much ,0
the group project,0
"Sometimes the homework takes me longer than I anticipate, but I think that's more of a factor of me still learning Python as I go.",0
The required randomness with the group assignment selections. ,0
I generally dislike group work but it hasn't been bad,0
"I do not like the group project. I think our idea is doomed and has no answerable data, but we've already gone ahead with our project proposal and have started working on it. I wish we got to choose groups like they did last quarter and instead there was an option if you wanted a random group assignment.",0
Not much as of now,0
The  information that we have to remember.,0
I've disliked the lack of guidance or instruction for the group projects. It would be nice to have access to the project rubric to make sure we are meeting all requirements. ,0
Hard grading on project proposal. 3 percent grade lost because rubric was unclear.,0
The lecture go through things in a quick pace. The group project is also hard for me because it is hard to meet with all groupmates; everyone's schedule is full.,0
"I have liked least the large of  material we are covering in lecture, mostly because I don't have a background in python or data science.",0
"The lack of weekly communication from my group members has me worried, hopefully incorrectly, I'll find out.",0
Nothing really,0
The professor focus too much on statistics and spend insufficient time in coding,0
The only thing I don’t like is the professor’s pace. She talks a little too fast but I just rewatch the podcast later which helps a lot,0
"I like having groups, but I wished it was more structured, since I do not have experience in data science projects so it hard to gage what needs to be done",0
Project proposal. The instruction and rubric is not clear enough,0
:),0
"I can't really think of anything, other than the class is only 10 weeks long.",0
Lack of hours and help,0
Working in a group with people I don’t know,0
The lecture pace is a bit too fast,0
What I have liked the least of COGS108 is that I have had trouble with the assignments since I came in with a matlab background and not a python background. So basically not knowing the language has been tough. ,0
"For now, everything is fine except the fact that I got stuck in part 3g in A3. Cannot pass validation no matter how and the assertion error is not helpful either.",0
"Thus far, the assignments have felt a bit disconnected from lecture. We learn something in lecture one week and don't get to exercise the skills until a week or two later. I think this is due to the bi-weekly deadlines which is nice but creates a bit of delay for the concepts.",0
The proposal for group project. The instructions and rubrics are not clear enough. ,0
"For the first EDA, Since I knew little about American politics, I am confused about the nouns that I encounter during the class, maybe it’s because my fault, since I finish I previous study abroad. Actually when I discuss with the local students, they seem also confused and google a lot. However it was not such a big problem and I can still understand the whole thinking process.",0
"I don't gain very much through the lectures just because I feel like most of the topics discussed are about practicing experimental design which I am proficient in via teaching biology experimental design and my own research. However, it is nice to have it explained explicitly and reminded of all considerations that are needed for data analysis.",0
"I don't enjoy working with my group. Also, I don't like how the assignments are graded. I wish they reflected my understanding of the logic, rather than if I wrote every line exactly how it's supposed to be written. I think more holistically graded assignments, where the end product is graded, would be better for me.",0
groups. it's hard to get agreement from everyone and it wants a lot of time.,0
Too many case studies. I think the lectures where you taught us actual coding is much more useful,0
Too much case studies. I would like more learnings on direct codes,0
"Randomly assigned group, I don't like to work with people that I didn't know before. And I didn't get a chance to know what their skill set are to work with me. This causes a lot issues and inconveniences.",0

"the speed of the class - I feel like the professor talks really fast and goes through the slides really quickly, sometimes I haven't even looked at the slide and we're already on the next slide. so please go slower :)",0
The internet in the classroom is horrible.,0
Case Study,0
None,0
pretty good,0
"Though I do like my group partners, planning a meeting time was extremely difficult as we realized the group assignments were based on topic of interest rather than availability.",0
Group project,0
Class structure would be more effective if hands-on? Or if I had an incentive to take notes and retain information actively instead of referring to class lecture files/slides,0
assignment,0
eh,0
It's too independent; taking only one python introductory class and having actual projects given my whole group feels lost. A2 took me a week while some CS students took 5 minutes to complete. I had to google 90% of the codes A2 was asking for. It was just to complete at one point and submit. Working in a group made me realize some people know more about coding while others don't have experience at all and that leaves the workload on mostly the ones who know coding the most or have the most leadership skills. ,0
"Not being able to pick my own teammates, but I understand the logic behind it.",0
I have liked everything so far.,0
Clickers can be annoying,0
I am not enjoying the group project. I am having trouble contributing because I have less experience than my peers.,0
None,0
Working on a project with a group. I dislike group work because the process is out of my hands and I don't deal well with arbitration.,0
"While I understand why the Case Studies exist, I feel like the pace of these lectures are much slower than they need to be and the attitude of the class seems very indifferent to these case studies.",0
"In some of the programming assignments so far, despite going to every single discussion, I still feel lost and have to seek additional help.",0
I don't like the COGS108 project.,0
group project,0
Having to work with other people I do not know.,0
"Not as much structure for the group project (ie: no weekly deadlines), so it's easy to fall a bit behind on it.",0
"Not choosing partners in group project makes it really difficult to meet up. Normally for group projects, people could choose people in the same college which would make it really easy for the group to meet up. However with random assignment there is a mix of on campus and off campus people who will have barely any time to meet up. ",0
Assigned groups. I enrolled in the class with a group of friends under the assumption that we’d get to work together as in previous iterations of the course.,0
My group and I feel lost on the final project.,0
My group and I feel lost on the final project.,0
The sections are not that engaging. At least my discussion section.,0
5 people in a group. It has been really hard to get everyone in my group on the same page and to all find a time to meet at the same time. Smaller groups would be nice (3-4 people),0
My group and I feel lost about the final project.,0
I think the lectures are a little fast. As someone who doesn't have too much coding experience sometimes I don't really truly understand what is going on in class or how to work on the assignments.,0
Github,0
Length of assignments ,0
Sometime the lecture is going kind of fast.,0
"I don't have a good python/coding background so the lectures are too fast for me. But at this point I can still finish the homework following the instructions, but the lectures are so difficult to follow (even though I know they are too easy for those data science/cs students).",0
Lectures are boring. ,0
Some portions of the assignment are difficult to understand but it is probably because the assignment is helping students work harder to solve the problem. ,0
"I'm finding it difficult to actually do the assignments, but that's because this class assumed previous knowledge.",0
We could not choose teams for final project.,0
"I hope we can form our own project group rather than being allocated because if we group with our friends, we know better with each other and will be more confident when doing the project.",0
"Grading for assignments. For the first assignment especially, some of the edge cases felt extremely unexpected given the description; it didn't seem like the edge case was encompassed by intended functionality that you described.",0
"Professor was going too fast, it's getting better recently",0
Lectures are very boring and don't hold my attention.,0
Everything goes well.,0
"Final project, I have a team (but not really)",0
Group Project. The project that we focus on are so board and it is hard to narrow down and use most of the skills we have learned from class.,0
I don't like how we were paired with people who we didn't get along with. I understand that it's meant to simulate real life but some people on my team are very mean. Almost like we're in high school again and I'm being bullied.,0
I was not able to catch up with some logic along with the data analysis part. I am always lost in terms of why we pick certain way to approach some questions.,0
Lectures aren't engaging,0
My project team.,0
"I don't like that I can't choose my group. I do understand why that's the case in this class, but I got stuck with a group who can't even find a time all four of us will meet",0
The topic of linear regression was confusing :(,0
So far it is the final project since my group is just getting started and it is pretty open-ended at the moment. It seems like a pretty daunting task but I think it well get better as we put in more work.,0
"I really do not like the discussion sections. I want to emphasize this a lot because I have gone to multiple sections whether it is a TA or IA. All of them seem pointless to attend due to the lack of help you can receive in them. The procedure at these discussions is everyone simply sitting down, and the TA/IA waits until an individual has a question on their assignment. I think this is great in terms of office hours, but as an entire section seems to be pointless. Especially for those who are generally confused with the course. There is no form of recap or discussion occurring in these sections. ",0
I most i dont like about cogs 108 so far is not having the option of choosing own teammate. I understand that in industry you dont get to work with people you like but i feel like for class projects it is good to work with our friends because we have similar interests thats more than other people put on paper.,0
feeling like a burden to my group,0
"The assignments are very long, time consuming, and difficult especially because I have no prior knowledge of python.",0
No check points for final project in the middle. Makes it very hard to keep the team and myself motivated.,0
Group Work.,0
"I didn't really like the topics chosen for the examples. Take the US Senate and Housing for example for EDA. As an international student who didn't really know much about US Government, it is hard to keep up with the rules and things going on in the Government.",0
Pressure to be in a group,0
Not having Sona.,0
Nothing so far,0
Lectures feel like common sense material or just basic statistics that I've already learned. I feel like the final project is un structured. Perhaps it was designed like this to allow students more flexibility in coordinating to work on it though.,0
The statistics part of lectures which is necessary for us to learn but is kind of boring ,0
Lecture Case Studies,0
I am still pretty unsure how to start my project. ,0
The lack of direction on python usage,0
"I'm not a big fan of how the assignments often have many questions that need to be looked-up from alternate sources, since when learning a new concept, many of these sources lead to contradictory information that just confuses a new learner even more.  ",0
Some of the lectures aren't as interesting when its not very interactive.,0
Not much! Keep up the great work : ),0
nothing,0
Hands free project guidance,0
I’m sometimes worried I’m learning incorrectly using information from the internet. ,0
I still feel a little lost with the group project. I wish their was a little more guidance in the beginning; I would have loved a quick 1-on-1 with one of the TA's to make sure my group was going into the right direction.,0
the groups are randomized. Class pace too fast,0
"group projects, its hard to work together given all of us have different responsibilities and schedules",0
I’d like some of the lectures to help with hw,0
Not being able to pick teams,0
"The API pages for Python are somewhat confusing (and at times outdated) because of the unnecessary optional parameters, and so I wish that there was a more helpful way to understand the proper usage of some library functions, especially for plotting graphs.",0
none,0
"Feeling a bit lost with the final project, the lack of structure is daunting.",0
Everything seems good so far.,0
No complaints :),0
The lectures are kind of boring,0
Notbing,0
No guest lectures yet,0
The real world topics don't apply to what I know about,0
Nothing!,0
I somewhat dislike that I sometimes find it difficult to take notes during lectures when the lecture slides (both PDF and Jupyter notebooks) are clicked through quickly.,0
The lack of understanding of why I missed points on assignments,0
"Nothing. The course has been great, taught at a good pace, and assignments are both challenging and rewarding. ",0
I don't like working in a group that I'm forced into.,0
"I felt the grading of the project proposal was a bit harsh. I was under the impression it was more of a rough draft, and as long as we put in reasonable effort in crafting a question, finding data, and analyzing some potential problems, we would get more credit. I will definitely bring it up in office hours.",0
Speaking is kind of too fast.,0
The lecture style as it focuses too much on case and less about teaching students how to use python to get the data they want,0
Sometimes its hard to understand and she tends to go pretty fast sometime,0
It's hard to see the relation to topic lectures and final projects,0
How some of the assignments aren't very clearly worded.,0
Randomly assigned final project teammates.,0
The group I'm in has kind of relegated me to an editor role because I'm the only native speaker and don't have as much of a coding background as other people in the group.,0
Sometimes the code does not work.,0
"- Group project, team members who aren't proactive/don't contribute their ideas and team members who disagree with a lot of things and overpower others' ideas with their own (but I can deal with it) 
- Technical lecture notes are hard to study/learn from sometimes due to the length and clutter (perhaps a ""cheat sheet"" of all the useful python functions for each purpose could be helpful)",0
Wish there was more python review in lecture for  first week or two,0
I have liked the number of lectures per week the least.,0
No finals,0
Final project with a bunch of random people. Building the chemistry within the team is pretty challenging.,0
The second assignment is too long!,0
"the course website is poorly organized, it’s difficult to navigate the github repo to find information ",0
none,0
None so far ,0
The low informational content of lecture.,0
I find that the class moves kind of fast. It's hard to take notes during lecture. ,0
"group work, hard to find an good time for everyone",0
I think sometimes it's not as helpful when we go over the code in class and how to use the different packages because we go through it so quickly its hard to actually absorb how to use it and the proper syntax.,0
"the project is really open ended and working with assigned people has been difficult, especially with scheduling.",0
"The group work is stressful, especially because of the proportion of the grade taken up by the project. Coordination can be difficult despite the best of intentions on each member's part, and losing several points on the proposal felt devastating when my group believed that we had satisfied the requirements. ",0
"I think the fact that groups were assigned randomly is something I don't like very much because there's an aspect of not being able to meet up to talk about important things as much as I would like to. Meeting up would make things a lot easier but I think because everyone has their own busy schedule, it's really difficult to coordinate meetings at times. I would have preferred to group with people I know that I can communicate with from the start.",0
The group assignment. I believe that the random teammate assignment is putting way more pressure than I expected coming into the course as most of my teammates have little to no experience with coding. ,0
"Lecture goes too fast, covers tons of materials",0
the group project - some of my group members were non-responsive even when it came close to the proposal deadline,0
The professor talked a bit fast,0
the group project,0
case study,0
"The example for EDA, for international students, I feel the topic of congress and newspapers readership is not so engaging as we lack the background knowledge of these. I did not even know about the composition of the congress and pulitzer prize. A lot of my friends said these two are not interesting to them as well.",0
The lecture. I don't like attending the lecture.,0
The topics the data is about in the case study is always about politics,0
Some part of the assignments are vague and I am not really sure how to approach the problem. So I have to make Piazza post and wait for a response before moving on. I think if the directions were a little bit clearer it would help. ,0
Project because we need to deal with tons of data.,0
not a lot of explanatioins how to execute different things in python,0
step by step study,0
The write up for the the project proposal,0
"Personally, I don't like discussing-style lecture.",0
Working on a group project. I think i would prefer an individual project or more hw.,0
The assignments :(,0
"The class is a bit too big, and lectures tend to be noisy.",0
Pace of the flass,0
Not having the option to pick your group for final project,0
The lectures are really difficult to pay attention to the entire time. Switching between python and actual lectures makes it hard to take notes and I find myself getting into one thing and then being jerked out of it. I also don't really like how the lectures teach the code but I don't know if there's a way to improve it.,0
Group project. I understand why we got random members but I still believe forming group by ourselves will work better.,0
Assignments can be more frequent,0
Having to go to lecture and work in groups,0
I did not really enjoy the group project. I think a lot of people in my group are very good at python. But I am a beginner. They do not really listen to my opinions.,0
The projects; specifically how they're all brand new libraries ,0
The assignments. There should be a clearer tutorial for python.,0
How long it takes to get some questions answered and that IA's seem to not be able to answer a lot of the questions regarding logistics,0
"I don't like having to work in a group for the project, I generally prefer to work alone.",0
"The lecture is fast for me. also, one case study was about politics which I have very little knowledge about, so I think general topics like the second one which was about newspapers are easier to understand.",0
Working on a group where I have to use data science with a topic that I could care less about.,0
"Nothing, the class is awesome.",0
There is nothing that I like least about the class. ,0
"I don't really like some of the lectures, that's because a lot of it has been review for me. The lectures themselves are actually good lectures in my opinion though.",0
I have most disliked the assigned final project group. I find that it brings a lot difficulties and to what would be a fun and engaging project.,0
Lack of Python instructions :(,0

Data wrangling,0
Probably the homework.,0
I think lectures are not organized and they are extremely confusing. It would help if they were catered in a more content / topic based way. The homeworks are extremely difficult if you don't have python experience ,0
Too little knowledge about Python in lecture while assignments ask for too much pre-knowledge in Python,0
lecture too big. hard to pay attention,0
"The thing I have liked least about Cogs 108 is certain aspects of the assignments given. Though I appreciate the coding experience I gain from the assignments, I feel that the material covered on them does not align with the material covered in class.",0
Lecture,0
"not being able to choose our group - although I do like my current group, I would have liked to choose my own group because I am more comfortable holding my friends accountable for their parts of the project. In the past, I have often done more than my own share of the project because of slacking project partners.",0
I don't like the final project group. Because some of my group mates did nothing and didn't come to the group meeting. ,0
"The final project felt a bit ambiguous, maybe needed more guideline",0
I'm not a fan of the python language.,0
Some parts of the class I feel we could spend more time on but that is a price to pay to cover as much ground as we do in this class.,0
That i can’t find group members on my own with people who i want to work with,0
We were not able to form our own groups.,0

The coding explanations. Its not explained quite well to understand python,0
Final project.,0
Coding python without any prior knowledge,0
Some lectures I feel have no direction,0
"The least thing I like about COGS108 is about the group situation and how the project is being explained and proposed. There are still a lot of confusions between what exactly needed to be done. Otherwise, I really like the course so far. ",0
The feedback comes rather late for the next assignment. ,0
Speed of lecture,0
The process of dealing with unresponsive teammates has been the least enjoyable part of the class up to this point. ,0
I wish I could fit a section into my schedule but unfortunately it hasn't worked out that way.,0
It has been really challenging figuring out the process of coding in python.,0
"I found the group project hard, especially with such big groups. ",0
I feel like lecture covers a lot more and I would like to cover the concepts deeply with more implementations/clicker questions to check if we really understand the concept.,0
The lecture slides is sometimes not as helpful as the jupyter notebook,0
EDA cases; In terms of coming up with data science questions and the topic of the EDA cases. It may be because I don't find topics interesting.,0

I felt that it took time to search for codes. And sometimes it's hard to debug.,0

I'm not familiar with politics but the main example is about politics.,0
the fact that the group partners were assigned :--(,0
Team project,0
"I don't know much about Python and it is really hard to do the assignments without any Python background, even though I am used to Java. The lectures don't focus enough on basic method use. Also, sometimes the TAs don't know how to do the PAs so it can make it challenging to get help.",0
