"The EDA lectures. I like them, but I do not feel like we need to have two of them. I would have liked that time to go towards other topics of data science, or so that we can have topics like runtime or efficiency within data science, since I feel like that would be extremely helpful for our projects (especially if we were to deal with extremely large datasets). I would also have liked to possibly expanded more on missing data and how to deal with that. The third assignment deals with Beautiful Soup and web scraping a bit, but I feel like it wasn't covered as much as it should have. Overall, part of the compromise of teaching such a breadth of material limits the depth we go into, but I still feel like some areas should be covered more (pandas, numpy, efficency, etc.) ",least

assignment,least
eh,least
It's too independent; taking only one python introductory class and having actual projects given my whole group feels lost. A2 took me a week while some CS students took 5 minutes to complete. I had to google 90% of the codes A2 was asking for. It was just to complete at one point and submit. Working in a group made me realize some people know more about coding while others don't have experience at all and that leaves the workload on mostly the ones who know coding the most or have the most leadership skills. ,least

"I really do not like the discussion sections. I want to emphasize this a lot because I have gone to multiple sections whether it is a TA or IA. All of them seem pointless to attend due to the lack of help you can receive in them. The procedure at these discussions is everyone simply sitting down, and the TA/IA waits until an individual has a question on their assignment. I think this is great in terms of office hours, but as an entire section seems to be pointless. Especially for those who are generally confused with the course. There is no form of recap or discussion occurring in these sections. ",least
I most i dont like about cogs 108 so far is not having the option of choosing own teammate.

"I think the fact that groups were assigned randomly is something I don't like very much because there's an aspect of not being able to meet up to talk about important things as much as I would like to.
