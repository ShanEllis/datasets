I would also have liked to possibly expanded more on missing data and how to deal with that. The third assignment deals with Beautiful Soup and web scraping a bit, but I feel like it wasn't covered as much as it should have. Overall, part of the compromise of teaching such a breadth of material limits the depth we go into, but I still feel like some areas should be covered more (pandas, numpy, efficency, etc.) ",0,sp19

It's too independent; taking only one python introductory class and having actual projects given my whole group feels lost. A2 took me a week while some CS students took 5 minutes to complete. I had to google 90% of the codes A2 was asking for. It was just to complete at one point and submit. Working in a group made me realize some people know more about coding while others don't have experience at all and that leaves the workload on mostly the ones who know coding the most or have the most leadership skills. ,0,sp19

All of them seem pointless to attend due to the lack of help you can receive in them. The procedure at these discussions is everyone simply sitting down, and the TA/IA waits until an individual has a question on their assignment. I think this is great in terms of office hours, but as an entire section seems to be pointless. Especially for those who are generally confused with the course. There is no form of recap or discussion occurring in these sections. ",0,sp19
I most i dont like about cogs 108 so far is not having the option of choosing own teammate.

"If we can get more instructions and information about the final project during discussion sessions/outside of class, such as a project lab session might help a lot on pushing the group project to be done with the right direction. Sometimes it may easily get lost since it's a first data science project for some of the students, and we cannot do it very efficiently by spending time exploring everything ourselves.",0,wi20
I get points deducted on homework even when the answers make sense,0,wi20
Meeting up with project group can be a struggle since the group has many people.,0,wi20
"I feel like the lectures could be more concise(in terms of number of words said and spacing between words, not in terms of time) (Hemingway's Iceberg Theory). 

To give a specific example from today's lecture(2/18/20), on the podcast from 9:35-10:12, the slide involves the linear regression from our last lecture. I feel like there's not much to say about our linear equation, and a simply structured sentence about how last time we fit our data to a line would suffice to cover this concept.",0,wi20

Principles that needs to remember,0,wi20
"I don't like the ambiguity of the assignments. They covers a large portion of the grade, which requires a prefect score to get a good final grade and costly to even miss a single question. For example in A3 there's a question asking about ""By looking at the plot you just generated, approximately how many people in df do the data suggest took no steps?"" The figure shows about 1000 people in the bin near 0, however, by a closer look, the data is actually -1, which often indicates missing data. There's a contradiction between instruction and question.",0,wi20

I do not like the weekly quizzes.,0,wi20
"8am lectures, but can't really change anything about that. The fact that to regrade request an assignment, we have to submit a public post to everyone in the class, asking for specific points back, instead of a possible built in regrade button inside the assignments tab under jupyterhub.",0,wi20
"Seems to include a lot of important topics in data science, but only goes very briefly in every single one of them.

"The coding aspect, because any little mistake can be time costly and misread easily haha.",0,wi20
I do not like how strictly the assignments were graded,0,wi20

"Although the assignments are not difficult, there's too few tolerance for faults. A small mistake can cause a significant deduction in the overall grade, and causes a lot of stress on the student. I prefer more difficult assignments with lenient grading that tests the student's knowledge of the course materials rather than whether the student is careful or not. Also, the assignment should focus more on data analysis as a data scientist, and less on some minor details of pandas and python. It would be much less stressful for the student when they know that their grade was deducted because they did not master the material than if it's because they were not careful enough when doing the homework.",0,wi20

Data Science,1,sp20
I've enjoyed the video lectures the most. I find them very informative and punctual at the same time.,1,sp20
I really enjoy the topics we've learned and I like using Jupyter notebook because it's convenient being able to run code together with the notes. ,1,sp20
Ive liked the homework assignments and how they build on what we learned from lectures. Theyre also not too time consuming which is nice.,1,sp20
"Honestly, it's the fact the there are no tests, the times between when assignments are due are nice and long, which cause no stress and we can do them at our leisure, making sure we really understand the concepts! ",1,sp20
I have enjoyed the format through which the lectures have been provided. The videos that we are responsible for watching are so well-made that I might have ended up watching them even if I was not taking COGS 108 currently.,1,sp20
Working on Assignments ,1,sp20
I like the concept and the Notebook assignments because I have never used pandas before so it is good for me to practice,1,sp20
the assignments have been a great opportunity to get hands-on experience with data science,1,sp20
The assignments are very well-designed and fun to complete.,1,sp20

I have enjoyed the video lectures and sections the most. They have been helpful to me.,1,sp20
"I've really enjoyed learning how to use datahub and work with jupyter notebooks. The material feels very relevant to real life, and is genuinely interesting. I also like how the videos are all broken up into segments instead of having one big fifty minute video, because this is way better for my attention span. ",1,sp20
Learning about different packages that I can use inside of Python.,1,sp20
"I've enjoyed how practical the course is so far. I know we haven't gotten to far into the more advanced materials, but I like how were working more with data rather than theory so it feels like I'm actually doing something.",1,sp20
I enjoyed learning about the applications of data science and actually learning about techniques. ,1,sp20
"I have enjoyed seeing how data can be analyzed using Python, and how it comes together when an adequate research question is asked. ",1,sp20

I really enjoy the assignments and what we have learned in the class.,1,sp20
"The lecture videos are great in helping me understand basic data science concepts, and the projects help to put my understanding to practice.",1,sp20

Learning Python. Its been nice to finally have a reason to learn the language ,1,sp20
I have enjoyed learning how to manipulate data and using pandas.,1,sp20
The project proposal was really interesting to write. We spent a lot of time thinking of what we wanted to do and gathering data and prior works was really fun.,1,sp20
"I like the style of the lecture. Each videos are short so it encourages students to learn rather than falling asleep in a 50mins long lecture video. I also like the structure of the hws, they guide students step by step and also encourage students to research more as well",1,sp20
Learning about data science,1,sp20
I learned a lot about panda and analyzing data,1,sp20
How straight forward the lectures and assignments are,1,sp20

I enjoy how straight forward assignments are. ,1,sp20
"Lectures, lectures are really cleared and well-explained. ",1,sp20

"Playing with data, statistics tool",1,sp20
Not too bad,1,sp20
The professor and her humor on piazza. Shes very understanding and always willing to help when I am stuck on something.,1,sp20
I have enjoyed lecture the most so far. The professor makes everything very easy to understand with the concept explanations and then the examples in the python notebooks.,1,sp20
Understandable lectures and flexible schedule. I can spend the first half of the week learning material then spend the rest of the week doing the homework.,1,sp20
I like learning about creating more effective and clean sets of data; I think tidy data is important and it helps create meaningful visuals.,1,sp20
organized course content - everything is easy to access and find. Feels like the professor is competent with Canvas/github/remote learning,1,sp20
The lecture notebooks are really helpful,1,sp20
Learning about data frames. I have been using the older method of opening a csv and parsing it line by line.,1,sp20
"I have enjoyed the course material the most. We have been working our way through the scientific method, from question to data to analysis, which I think is pretty cool.",1,sp20
the concept is meaningful,1,sp20
This is the best asynchronous class I am taking this quarter. I enjoy the small lecture + quiz format. It makes it easy to keep on pace with the course.,1,sp20
"The teaching method, this can really help me understand a lot things",1,sp20
Ive been enjoying the way lectures are posted on YouTube in a chunk of smaller videos instead of one long 50 minute video. ,1,sp20
Programming assignments are interesting,1,sp20
explain the overview of data analysis process,1,sp20
There are a lot of resources available to students. I appreciate Prof. Ellis's flexibility and understanding. She is very helpful during office hours. The course material is interesting and very useful for industry. ,1,sp20

Most of all I have enjoyed the topics and the approach this class takes to teaching the topics. The videos are straightforward and get to the point which is nice. ,1,sp20
The wide variety of knowledge and application in python,1,sp20
"I've enjoyed learning more in depth about the data science process through our course material. It's interesting learning about the gist of what data scientists do from a guest lecturer for an hour, but I've found that it's even more interesting to learn about the different pieces of the puzzle/method progressively in an interactive way. I have a larger appreciation for what data scientists do even more so now. ",1,sp20
I really enjoy the lectures video and how its broken down into separate videos; I am able to understand the concepts more easily and can refer back to the videos.,1,sp20
the flexibility of accessing lectures,1,sp20
"What I've enjoyed the most was being able to learn about new data models, and specifically how approach data based off what type of analysis you want to perform. I think it is very useful know the specifics for each and how to really approach data sets.",1,sp20
The lecture videos were very concise and clear. I also like that each video is short to keep the audience's attention.,1,sp20

I liked how I could move at my own pace.,1,sp20
"I have enjoyed many things, learning python, a new environment(datahub/notebooks) learning introductory steps of data science and how to manipulate that data with python. 

But what I have enjoyed most is learning in general this course does a great job of balancing rigor, work, and comprehension time. All the slides are also very appealing to the eye and therefore easier to digest and comprehend. I really enjoy this course.      ",1,sp20
The group project,1,sp20
The assignments have been the most enjoyable and where I actually feel I put to practice what I learn.,1,sp20
I really enjoy all of the data visualization,1,sp20

"the example, like what we can do with the real dataset",1,sp20
"The ease of the course, it helps lower my stress",1,sp20
I've enjoyed the structured videos they are very well done and I like how it is organized. I love that we are actually doing data science as a way to learn about it.,1,sp20
the recorded video,1,sp20
"I really enjoyed how statistics and programming is combined in this course. It starts off very simple and explains both sides. I took a CSE class similar to this course and the professor just assumed you knew how to program and basic statistics terms. There was no datahub so I had to figure out Jupyter Notebooks and python on my own. If I had taken this course before that class, I think I would have enjoyed it more. ",1,sp20
I enjoy interactive learning through Jupyter notebook examples and assignments,1,sp20
The Assignments thus far,1,sp20
How it is broken down simplistically so I can learn efficiently as I am a slow learner and lack a lot of background knowledge that I was scared would hinder me in this class,1,sp20
"I think I've enjoyed the group project the most. I think it was really fun getting to talk to a group of classmates and throw around ideas for a research project. Getting to know what others were interested in and how we might approach answering a question with data analysis was really nice, especially just getting to talk to people again like you would during discussion sections or lecture. ",1,sp20
The way the content is taught is extremely interesting! I like how the videos are split up,1,sp20
I've enjoyed the programming assignments because they help me remember how to use Python,1,sp20
the flexibility that we have with watching lectures,1,sp20
Python pandas practice,1,sp20
"I have experience learning pandas and I can say that I have enjoyed how you have framed this as well as numpy. I also like how you incorporated git. As a DSC major, no one has really explained the processes under the hood in github and I can say that I was really happy to have learned more about it.",1,sp20
I don't personally care too much about the topics being taught in COGS 108 however what I was really impressed with is how much effort the TAs/Tutors and especially the professor is putting in. I recall on one of the past surveys asking for an open answered response I just put in something semi random but I received an email response back that specifically responded to what I had said. I was really surprised because I think that was the first time I ever received a personalized response to one of the hundreds of surveys I've had to fill out. Seeing you all work hard to respond to all the students showed that you really care about your students makes me want to work hard as well! Also the errors in editing you have sometimes are really funny as well.,1,sp20
I'e enjoyed the interactive notebook for lectures as well as being able to work ahead if i need/ move at my own pace. ,1,sp20
"Learning to use Python, since programming is my interest",1,sp20

The idea of manipulating large sets of data and cleaning it was entirely new to me and it has been a very interesting experience,1,sp20
learning visualization and data analysis methods,1,sp20
The idea of working with data (such as A2 assignment),1,sp20
"I love how the class is 1/2 programming and 1/2 subject content. It keeps thing new and engaging. If we only learned code, I know I would be overwhelmed very quickly. If we learned only subject content I know I would feel bored. The mix of both makes me engaged. I also feel if the two weren't mixed in the way they are now, I wouldn't be able to make the same connections with code and content",1,sp20
The data analysis that we covered and what it means in relation to the final project,1,sp20
Understanding data science,1,sp20
I enjoyed attempting to think from the perspective of a data scientist in formulating a project approach.,1,sp20
ummm seeing many different graphs,1,sp20

The assignments. The lectures are informative but you only understand the applications when you do the assignemnts. ,1,sp20
Writing code. There is immediate feedback and feels like I am learning something useful.,1,sp20
"I've been enjoying the topics covered in the discussion section, which is more focused on the programming aspect of Python. Although as of right now most of the topics are stuff like data structures or concepts that I already have a grasp on, it's really improving my understanding on these things. As a math major, it's a very common occurrence for me to be able to do something programmatically, but not actually understand why it works.

It's also nice that the a lot of the examples on the video lectures are real case studies. It makes it easier to grasp a concept. Some of the stuff like ethics on data science are also things I've never learned before, so it was really interesting for me.",1,sp20
I enjoy the assignments the most because it is practical training.,1,sp20
Learning about how to format data,1,sp20
Group project is very interesting and our group picked a topic we all had a lot of interest in which makes it even better doing the actual project,1,sp20

Yes. The instructions are incredibly clear and concise and the personal feedback is appreciated.,1,sp20
"Lectures are easily accessible so I can pause when I need to, or go back and watch an explanation over and over again until I understand it!",1,sp20
"I've really enjoyed understanding and learning the different ways that data is actually used and parsed. Previously I had a blackbox mental model of how it ""big data"" worked, but I think this class is helping me ground it into how it actually happens.",1,sp20
videos are very informative ,1,sp20
"So far, it's been all the new concepts from data science that is pretty interesting as well as the overall flow of the class.",1,sp20

"Too early to say, but conceptually, the content. I haven't dealt with much that we have learned practically as I have not started on A2, but I am excited based on the topics we have discussed in lecture. ",1,sp20
"Learning about the different ways to visualize data has been really interesting. The presentation of data is something that I didn't think too much about before this class, so it was really interesting to learn the different ways data can be visualized. Things like how a data table is organized and how charts differ from one another put data and statistics into context. ",1,sp20
"I think the Professor is really good at presenting complex topics in an easy to understand, and less daunting manner.",1,sp20
"I like the coding part, cuz using code to solve problems is very cool.",1,sp20
I like that the videos are split by topic bc it makes the content more digestable. also the quick quizzes at the end are a good grasp check.,1,sp20
the material told in class,1,sp20
"The fact that quizzes are always Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. It forces a small regularity to my schedule. For example, one of my other classes has weekly quizzes, and I procrastinate until the day that quiz is due to catch up on an entire week's of material. Another one of my classes only has 3 grades: a midterm, another midterm, and a final. Yep, that's it. I only started studying for the first midterm the day of the midterm.",1,sp20
data,1,sp20
the practical skill been taught,1,sp20

online classes. I don't have to wake up at 8 am in the morning!,1,sp20
Able to concretely learn things about data science that I had only loosely learned before.,1,sp20
I enjoyed learning about the different concepts associated with data science and how they are relevant in different real world examples. Learning about git was also very useful information.,1,sp20
The professor's assumption that with some terms/ideas we might not be familiar with yet. This has elevated some pressure off the students for sure! I also think that splitting the lectures into parts to focus on specific topics has been important for me to sort and locate that information when necessary.,1,sp20

"lectures are a good timing and style, assignments are alright so far. I like the no tests thing (besides quizzes) ",1,sp20
The professor really explains things well. The tests are representative of what is in the lecturers. Also splitting up the lectures makes learning the topics easier. The examples we go over in lectures are pretty interesting and shows how what we're doing applies to real life.,1,sp20

Quiz. Too many quizzes to take.,0,sp20
I dont really enjoy the quizzes but it makes sense since it forces us to watch the lecture,0,sp20
"I don't like the clarity of grading. I feel like the quizzes often have some questions that ask about something that's really nuanced & I understand that the questions can't all be easy, but I don't think those question topics get enough attention in the video to give us the opportunity to have deeper thought about them. I also wish there was a way to turn in the assignments and see the grade on them before they're due (without necessarily seeing the correct answer) so we can get a better idea of how they're going.",0,sp20
Some questions in the quizzes are pretty tricky even though I pay close attention in lec I may still not get it right.,0,sp20
"I wish we could divide the course into two or three. Though it serves as a good stepping stone for learning data science, for many cogs students its where that course experience ends. To supplement this, Ill be taking cogs 109 and 188 but those classes are taught in Matlab. Itd be nice to have a central theme to some of these courses as python is arguably the most popular language for data science right now. ",0,sp20
"I think the hardest thing for me so far in this course has been learning how to use github, since it is a very different platform for me and I have never used anything like it before. ",0,sp20
"I feel like I am confused about many aspects of the course, whereas many other students are so far advanced that everything is a breeze. I only took cogs 18, so I am only really familiar with Jupyter notebooks; Github is very confusing and I don't really know how to do code on my local computer outside of jupyter. Additionally, the final project made me really confused, and I think I wrote a terrible proposal because I missed some of the information on Piazza.",0,sp20

"I think the pre-recorded lecture isn't conducive to me getting the most out of the course. I enjoy engaging with the material and my peers, and asking questions in real-time.

Honestly the quizzes feels a little bit overwhelming. Sometimes when there are 3 quizzes in a day I get caught up with work and have forgotten to finish the 3rd quiz on two separate occasions. I get that you want to check our understanding but sometimes it is hard to keep up with the quizzes,0,sp20
"The individual proposal felt fairly restrictive in what I could use, given the topic at hand.",0,sp20

there are too much quiz and too short time to consider for taking the quiz,0,sp20
No all things are pretty good,0,sp20
"Sometimes I forget to do the quizzes, which is on me, but some days the quizzes will be worth only 6 points in total and other days it will be worth like 15 points in total, and we only have 20 free points. So if you forgot on a day where theres not a lot of points, its fine, but if you forget on a day with a lot of points you could be using almost all your 20 free points on one day. I know its ideal that you dont forget but it would make more sense if the quizzes were worth the same points every day. I wish there was the ability to take the quizzes up to a day late for a little bit of credit. Its hard adjusting to online learning and Im not used to remembering to have to take a quiz every other day. Its different being in my home environment as opposed to being at school where I wouldnt forget to go to lecture. I just feel like theyre not really equivalent and I wish there was some more leniency.",0,sp20

Learning how to use GitHub and the whole repo/pushing/pulling/getting stuff to appear on my local versus remote desktop. I find all of that very confusing and I installed GitHub desktop but I still don't know how to make the group project repo appear into my repo under my GitHub username online (so I've just starred it for now).

We are all trying to get a good grade and the quizzes are a way to make sure we watch the lecture videos and have a grasp of the material. But believe if we were in a class setting and these questions were given as iclicker questions, we probably wouldn't be graded on them like we are now. I think if we were given multiple attempts for them we would be able to learn from our mistakes hence having the material stick in our heads better. ",0,sp20

"The coding assignments are my least favorite because of the fact that they implement hidden tests that you can't see so you have no way to telling if your code is entirely correct. I would perform the format where all of the tests are available to run and when we are finished with the assignment, we can see our final score based on what tests passed. In the real world, there are no hidden tests when we submit code so I don't really see a point to having hidden tests. ",0,sp20

I will remember the broad concepts of the video, and will remember some specific and technical things that stand out to me, but will miss others. Anything that I miss, I then learn and actually remember once I use them in practice. There have been 2 or 3 questions over the last 2 weeks or so that I felt are hard to answer after only watching a video, so overall it's not a big deal considering the grading scheme, but it is frustrating when I come across them.",0,sp20

"Definitely the quizzes. I don't have a big problem with having quizzes themselves but at times it feels like its just a bunch of busy work with no leniency on deadlines. I understand that you open up the quizzes the weekend before but a lot of the time I have another class that has priority for an assignment that's due Sun night, Mon night, etc. I believing something like having an extra day for the quizzes would help out a lot at times (Mon quizzes due Tue night, Wed due Thurs night, etc) as it would let me work on whatever I have to finish at the time and not have the COGS quiz in the back of my mind haunting me. One other thing for me personally is just having a little bit more time on some of the quizzes. I've always been a bit of a slow test taker and regarding these quizzes where sometimes the answer is one small thing mentioned in a 20 minute video I find myself going back and forward making sure I have the right answer and it eats up a lot of time for other questions.

"I don't like how I can't see other people besides my project team. I feel like I probably would have made friends in this class if there were actual in-person lectures to go to.

I'm very nervous about using it, still.",0,sp20
The material. I am extremely bad at python and data science and I have honestly no idea what I'm doing in this class. I have such little coding experience (of which none is in python) so for me I'm really struggling in this class. I'm not sure what would help me or make this class easier.

I think the quiz timer is a bit too short. I didn't have time to think about my answer,0,sp20
It feels like we glance over a lot of the material without applying it in another context than the example in the lecture. I think this concern has been augmented by the fact that we're not about to enter into discussions during a collective lecture. I suppose when I finish the second assignment I will have a more clear idea about how we are being tested for understanding of the materials.,0,sp20

"honestly this class is pretty good, i like everything about it. i guess the only thing i don't like is the fact that its online. I feel like having the experience in class, and getting the chance to interact with other students and the instructor in person would make this class even better than it already is.",0,sp20
Writing reports. It is tedious and mind-numbingly boring.,0,sp20
"-) A few of the github links seem to be broken or missing , like the ones for the individual project proposals. The template in the ipynb file was for the group project instead, and I had to go to a specific file path in order to find the correct template. 

-) I'm the type of person that likes to do assignments on one sitting and be done with it, so the video quizzes has been a bit of a hassle for me. I get that I can just finish the video assignments at the beginning of the week but it's a different kind of studying than doing the programming assignments, which is what I'm used to, if that makes sense. With the videos I really have to focus on them for ~10 minutes at a time, do the quiz, and then focus on another thing on the next video. It's also harder for me because I have ADD.

I totally understand that this is due to the sudden change of the course structure though, and I appreciate that these accommodations are made. This is just me being nitpicky lol.",0,sp20

But I also hope that the professor and TAs know that us students can make a lot of mistakes, especially when it comes to managing our time. Some of us can get carried away with projects and work in other classes that we forget to take the video quizzes. Instead of restricting the quiz right away after the deadline, maybe implement a late penalty for them. This is just a suggestion, I am not in any ways trying to tell the professor and TAs how to do their job. However, I do hope you guys can take this input into account. ",0,sp20

some topics are difficult,0,sp20
"The bulk of my worries with COGS108 comes from the assignments as they have been slightly tedious for me, mainly because I find myself getting confused at times due to the wording and that caused me to lose major points in A1. Also, I feel as though I was not entirely prepared for this course, since I did not have too much familiarity with Python, github, and datahub. Therefore, when doing the assignments I constantly find myself having to do more research that adds to the workload before I can understand if I am on the right track.",0,sp20
"This isn't really the fault of the class, but just online learning in general is difficult.",0,sp20
"The lecture quizzes, to be honest. I understand that the quizzes are meant to keep us on track when it comes to lecture material. However, I feel like (in my opinion), that there should be more flexibility when it comes to the quizzes. For example, in my opinion, there should be a little bit more time allotted for each question on the quiz, not 1 minute per question. I feel like allotting only one minute per question creates more pressure and its not enough time to come up with the correct answer or too look back at the notes to make sure/confirm the answer (especially when you accidentally missed something in the lectures). Also, allowing multiple attempts on the lecture quizzes could be nice too (without exposing the correct answers after taking it, of course), as this can make us look back at the lectures or lecture notes to see what we've missed and possibly got wrong. At the end of the day, it is your call as the professor. These are just suggestions to possibly consider to create a slightly better learning environment. Other than that though, no complaints :)",0,sp20
"I think the course is too spread out which causes the problem of too little attention for important topics. For example, while I was looking through the Linear Regression videos, I found that the videos did not nearly cover the detail required and that a lot of the important points were skimmed over too quickly. I have extensive experience in Statistics and in particular Linear Regression, but if I were a beginner who hadn't taken a college level Statistics course, I would really struggle to get all that detail in such a short space of time. To be clear, this isn't a criticism of teaching (Professor Ellis is one of the very best professors I've had the pleasure of learning from at UCSD), but one of time. I understand that quite a lot of topics need to be covered in this course, but perhaps the course can afford to lose some of the materials that are going to be covered to create time for future batches. 

Suggestion to fix this issue: After this quarter, the Professor will have a collection of videos which explain the topics really well. A possible solution is that some of the less engaging topics can be taught (say the earlier videos about Git and GitHub, some basic programming concepts such as pandas which students can easily pick up through online video and Jupyter Notebook Walkthroughs as well as by looking at the documentation available online) to the students via this medium while lecture time can be used for more engaging material (like going through the assumptions of Linear Regression and t-tests with more thoroughness and perhaps explaining the intuition behind those things, a full example of real-life data science projects etc).",0,sp20

Using datahub to see applications of the material we are learning,1,fa20
The assignments,1,fa20
I enjoy the pace of the class thus far. I enjoy how the class does not assume much prior knowledge despite the fact that it is possible many individuals joined the class with said prior knowledge.,1,fa20
"I really enjoy the introduction to Python, data science, and jupyter notebooks. As a computer science major, I have yet to take any data science courses, but I am aware computer science is heavily involved in data science and I am glad this class has introduced me to field to see if I enjoy it. As someone who has also never coded in Python before, I think its useful that I am being introduced to the language. Lastly, knowing of Jupyter Notebooks for so long, I am glad to finally be learning the tool.",1,fa20
structure and organization of the course,1,fa20

I like that the lectures are posted before the weekend so that I can watch them over the weekend when I have more free time. ,1,fa20
"I know next to nothing about coding (save for writing loops and what I have so far learned in this class), and yet this class has already put the idea in my head of maybe wanting to be a data scientist. I enjoy the fact that the professor seems to have communicated the practice of data science effectively, and from the persuasive perspective of someone who enjoys doing it. Genuinely, thank you Professor Ellis for turning my most feared class of the quarter into my favorite one. ",1,fa20
the ease of doing lectures and quizzes,1,fa20
"Working with my group mates, this is my first time doing a data science project and it has been fun working with them and learning more",1,fa20

I have learned how to deal with data and that is amazing.,1,fa20
I really like the coding portion from the assignments,1,fa20
"I am enjoying the Python applications of what we're leaning about statistics. I've spent time learning about it in theory, but using it in practice is always cool to implement and see. I've done so before with Math 185 in R, but Python feels more approachable for most people so it's interesting to try it there.",1,fa20
"I've enjoyed learning about data viz and how to use it, especially with the different libraries.",1,fa20
Learning to use python libraries to be able to actually do practical data science projects. Using the libraries like pandas and seaborn have helped me in my familiarity with these packages and confidence in performing more data science projects in the future. ,1,fa20

"I have enjoyed doing actual hands on work in Jupyter with pandas and dataframe, especially coming from a background of little coding knowledge. ",1,fa20
"I think I've enjoyed getting a more hands on experience with the coding aspect of the class, even though it is kind of difficult. It gives me experience with Python that I think is valuable both in class and outside the class too. I do especially enjoy the take home quizzes that makes the class easier to engage with the material. ",1,fa20
i enjoy the teaching style and pace. short video draw my attention that i do not easily lose my interest on those topics and the quiz are helpful for learning knowledge,1,fa20
Assignment,1,fa20
Clear lecture vide,1,fa20
"I've enjoyed working with my group to navigate the details of our project. We are all new to data science, so the process of learning and researching has been fun. ",1,fa20

I really like the asynchronous aspect of the course.,1,fa20
"Yes. I found COGS 108 is very helpful for my future career, and I can handle most of the materials of it.",1,fa20
The coding assignments. I appreciate how detailed the instructions and its clearly states what it wants us to do.,1,fa20
Experiencing the life of  a data scientist. It is a career that I am interested in.,1,fa20
The most interesting part of learning in COGS 108 is how much of can be applied to the real world problems. ,1,fa20
"The assignments, they are the hands on portion of what we learn in lecture",1,fa20
Learning Python is pretty interesting since I never thought of creating high-quality graphs from coding. ,1,fa20
"I like that the prerecorded videos are clear, concise, and edited down to the important points. ",1,fa20
Self-paced lectures,1,fa20
I enjoy deciding different kinds of graphs to use with different kinds of data. ,1,fa20
I love your lectures and how they are broken down. They are super informative and I don't fine myself loosing focus when I am watching them!,1,fa20
The bottom-up approach that assignments take in testing the material. I like how each assignment builds up to a large result (ie A3 with the final graph with linreg plotted).,1,fa20
The quizzes after each lecture allow me to truly see whether or not I understand the material that was taught in each video,1,fa20
The homework assigments,1,fa20
I enjoyed learning about data science techniques,1,fa20
Jupyter notebook is so exciting!,1,fa20
Learning how to use jupyter,1,fa20
the freedom to podcast whenever,1,fa20
I enjoy how informative the videos are,1,fa20
"What is a Data Analysis, how the data should be gathered before starting everything, how data should be prepared change my previous understanding of data science.",1,fa20
What I have enjoyed most about COGS 108 is how learning in this class is not impeded by natural instinct or talent in statistics or programming. Having the actual curiosity itself lends itself as a gateway to solving the problems when you are allowed to google things to experiment with and you have output to verify if your findings align with what is asked.,1,fa20
I enjoy the use of code in order to interpret and clean up data. I never knew that there were so many useful functions from programs like pandas and numpy that could streamline so many things.,1,fa20
Guest lecture! Vivian Peng is awesome!!!,1,fa20
The data visualization and tools have proven to be very useful. I am currently interning at Qualcomm and I immediately apply the knowledge I use in my work. ,1,fa20
Relatively clear expectations and well formatted lectures,1,fa20
"I enjoyed all the lessons on python coding, I know the point of this class is data analysis and not coding, but I really like coding. I also really like the way quizzes and videos are cut into chunks.",1,fa20
learning pandas. I think pandas would be useful in the future,1,fa20
Course video. Really help understand materials while maximize flexibility,1,fa20
the examples in class,1,fa20
"The homework, which gives very specific instructions and familiarizes me with the pandas package.",1,fa20
"I enjoy the lectures because although I'm not a Data Science major, it's always been something I've interested in, so it's cool to get exposed to this stuff!",1,fa20
Learning about and working with tools for data science. I've never done data science before so I enjoy working with pandas and analyzing data,1,fa20
The fact that it's in Python and we get to work on a project on our own. I love my team's project idea and I think it has motivated me to spend a lot of my off time writing code for it. ,1,fa20
I enjoyed the assignments and the office hours the most. I love how tutors explain the material so well to me and I hope it was more office hours or some 1-1 sessions. ,1,fa20
I have enjoyed the lectures about data visualization and things to be careful about. I had no idea how important this aspect of data science is.,1,fa20
The content I have learned in this course is really practical and useful.,1,fa20
"coding assignments, they're really fun to do because I feel like I'm applying the knowledge that I learned from class ",1,fa20
the good lectures and style of teaching,1,fa20
I have enjoyed some of the lectures. I think they are interesting and informative. ,1,fa20
The most interesting part of learning in COGS 108 is how much of can be applied to the real world problems. ,1,fa20
I actually like the Jupyter Notebook Python assignments as a way to learn about python and panda as I have no previous experience with the language,1,fa20
"I love the new topics we cover every week, and they're applicability in our data science project",1,fa20
The assignments are structured in a way that I actually learn the information asked,1,fa20
"Learning how to work with data using Python; lectures, including the guest speaker",1,fa20
the short videos every week ,1,fa20
"How the class is formatted, with no exams and lectures are videos that we can watch on our own time. I like these aspects because I feel less pressured to know everything in the course but am still actively learning.",1,fa20
I really enjoy the assignments. I find them challenging and fun to work on. ,1,fa20
The homework data were interesting. I didn't know tootsie roll was both fruity and chocolaty.,1,fa20
The fun and practical approach towards learning.,1,fa20
"The mini quizzes and the length of the short videos, but its rich, easily absorbable content. ",1,fa20
The videos and homework are clear,1,fa20
Python,1,fa20
"What I have enjoyed the most about COGS 108 so far are the lecture videos. They take less time than expected to complete, and are split up in a way so that I can take a break in between sets of videos.",1,fa20
Expanding my perspective on all the different things you can do with data and just how powerful and life-changing data can be. ,1,fa20
"the python, learning about what makes a data set good, what makes it bad.",1,fa20
it's more practical,1,fa20
"The assignments are very intuitive and basic and provide me with basic understanding of pandas and all the functionality that will be beneficial for a successful project. Therefore, I have enjoyed the assignments a lot.",1,fa20
"I honestly really liked the podcast-interview styled guest lecture with Vivian Peng. It was good to see the trajectory of someone's career (academic or otherwise) and how that related to data science, as well as having a few examples of how creativity and data science meet.",1,fa20
I like how there is a proper structure to the course.,1,fa20
Python basics.,1,fa20
I enjoy most on the material that is on the videos because they are very encouraging and interesting. The videos are where I learn the most. ,1,fa20
I have enjoyed learning how to use python and pandas. I did not feel confident with my coding skills but the assignments have helped me understand more the importance of syntax. ,1,fa20
The easy going pace of learning python,1,fa20
Piazza posts and videos. They are the most helpful with answering questions and are very useful,1,fa20
The guest lecturer. She really encouraged me and gave me so much hope for the future.,1,fa20
"I've been curious about data science but didn't know where to start, so I like the structured design and introduction of fundamentals that lead into more complex ideas",1,fa20
Python coding,1,fa20
Guest speakers since it is nice to hear their experiences and advice.,1,fa20
"I like how easy the lectures are to follow, I wish classes could be in person ,but I still find the lectures enjoyable and how each video is separated according to topic rather than having an hour long video with everything combined",1,fa20
Learning about data science and working with the pandas package. Working on the group project has also been fun so far.,1,fa20
The hands on nature of the assignments without being too difficult. ,1,fa20
I have enjoyed how flexible the course is and how I know due dates in advance ,1,fa20
It is cool that we can work on a read dataset,1,fa20
Being able to learn more about data analysis skills ,1,fa20
I enjoyed working with my group and being able to explore ideas with them.,1,fa20
"I have really enjoyed applying Python to the applications in this class. Coming from a cs background, I find it very valuable being able to apply my knowledge of programming in a different field like Data Science.",1,fa20
the guest lecture,1,fa20
"The videos are really well put together, informative, and concise.",1,fa20
The assignments. They are a challenge as I am new to programing and my last coding course was years ago but working through them has been rewarding,1,fa20
The mini lectures,1,fa20
Pacing of lecture (how information is broken up into manageable videos) and pandas library,1,fa20
PAs,1,fa20
The lecture recordings + the guest lecturer,1,fa20
The quick videos that I actually remember,1,fa20
"Using what we learn in lectures in our programming assignments, something I missed in COGS9",1,fa20
Group Project,1,fa20
The lectures are interesting,1,fa20
I've really liked being able to code again as the Cogs department is rather sparse in coding courses.,1,fa20
The assignments,1,fa20
The videos are the perfect length for understanding concepts,1,fa20
Assignment is kind of difficult to me. I never learned how to google some concepts,0,fa20
"Honestly, I am not a huge fan of remote learning, I would say thats the biggest problem right now. I feel like it takes away from the actual COGS 108 experience.",0,fa20
I'm not familiar with python and panda.,0,fa20
hmmm I feel like I am a little bit lost on how to conduct the final project along the course cause we are constantly learning new techniques,0,fa20
Nothing really so far. It's been nice.,0,fa20
On the homeworks I have to consistently struggle on questions and look up functions and syntax on google because I did not learn them from lecture,0,fa20
super random but I don't like how the lecture videos don't open a new tab when I click on them from github. but obviously this is a very minor thing,0,fa20
"I don't really have any major beef with this class so far, so I can't really complain.",0,fa20
I honestly think all parts of COGS 108 has been great so far!,0,fa20
On the homeworks I have to consistently struggle on questions and look up functions and syntax on google because I did not learn them from lecture,0,fa20
Some of the assignment multiple choice questions. They can be tricky at times.  ,0,fa20
i feel like there are too many quizzes and that it is stressful to keep up with constantly ,0,fa20
"This was the very first time I ever had to use github (not a Cogs major so definitely new to this) and I felt that there were very little guidance I was given to validate that component of the assignment (it wasn't a lot of work, but it was worth a lot and I had no way of knowing if I did it correctly). I lost a point for a silly reason - but I spent around 15-30 min on that portion as opposed to the 3 hours on the actual assignment of the material that was taught on class. To lose 13% of the entire assignment (or 1% of my entire grade) for that mistake was pretty hurtful.",0,fa20
Nothing to be honest.,0,fa20
Quiz on guest talk,0,fa20
Writing out my project proposal because writing is my weak point,0,fa20
No complaints.,0,fa20
The Final Project - a lot of freedom and flexibility ,0,fa20
I think during lecture we don't really go in depth into different concepts and they can only really be reinforced or learned by doing the assignments.,0,fa20
"I don't really like doing lecture quizzes, but I do them early so they're not too bad.",0,fa20
So far so good!,0,fa20
A3 was not released on Monday as it was promised; it was released on Tuesday instead. And no one responded during these times that A1 was being graded; might be nice to have one dedicated answerer during these times tbh,0,fa20
What I've liked least is that some of the main course documents are only on GitHub while I think some of the important ones should be on Canvas as well just for easier access. ,0,fa20
The individual proposal felt sort of confusing to do since our data set is predetermined.,0,fa20
The quiz answers can be tricky sometimes. ,0,fa20
"Sometimes it's difficult to get help because there are so many students in office hours, but I understand that it's such a big class and all the TAs are very helpful. ",0,fa20
"I have enjoyed the project proposal the least because it had asked us to prepare a possible question before we learned the different models and data science experiments (e.g. exploratory, inferential, etc.)",0,fa20
Slow feedback time on assignment grades (especially if an autograder grades it),0,fa20
"Group work - It takes up too much energy to work with 4 other UCSD students over the zoom call. Also,  I feel like everyone's expectation in this class is different.",0,fa20
"It can be difficult to pay attention to some of the longer lecture videos (that go through the notebooks, for example) without taking a lot of breaks.",0,fa20
Spending time debugging my coding errors,0,fa20
"1. The longer video lectures mostly because they are on the Python notebook and it's a little harder to take notes about code going on. I usually just download the notebook as a pdf and take notes on it directly as appropriate.
2. I really don't like that I can't see the answers on the quizzes right away. I never go back to check them because I always forget (also because I do them the weekend it is released and answers come out a week later so I don't even remember the ones I got wrong by then). I wished it were unlimited trys because I think it would've given me more incentive to know the right answers as I am taking the quiz.",0,fa20
the final project with less directions,0,fa20
I wish there were some synchronous lectures.,0,fa20
The video quizzes. Some questions are really confusing and not representative.,0,fa20
The quiz is sometime hard.,0,fa20
"quiz
I always got one question wrong",0,fa20
"project, as communication through zoom is not effective",0,fa20
I think having live lectures (that are recorded to later go back to) rather than recorded videos would be beneficial to maintain that classroom interaction between students and the professor.,0,fa20
"Question design of quiz/assignment. Some quiz questions have multiple viable answers, but some aren't considered correct because they aren't explicitly mentioned in the lecture. A1's git task might need extra guidance for students once waitlisted, and it might not want to deduct points solely based on naming errors. ",0,fa20
The content quizzes,0,fa20
I think the lectures are kind of long and they take me twice as long to do because I pause to take notes for them. ,0,fa20
I wish there was a more set/required time frame for final project progress to keep us on track.,0,fa20
The project proposal was confusing to me to do as an individual project. I wish the individual project could be done over the term as well. I am worried about doing the individual project during the last week of classes.,0,fa20
"Tis a great class, I don't think there is anything I particularly dislike.",0,fa20
It makes me want to cry because of how I don't understand sometimes. ,0,fa20
"I would prefer the due date for the Friday quizzes be on Saturday at least, because unlike the Monday and Wednesday quizzes, it feels much stricter.",0,fa20
Quizzes ,0,fa20
The daily quizzes are the worst.,0,fa20
"I like the quizzes the least. I often feel that I have gotten a good understanding of the lecture videos but still didn't do well in quizzes. Also, it happened to me once that I mistakenly started a quiz next to the one I wanted to click, and ended up getting almost 0 points since I haven't watched the corresponding video yet. I think it would be better if we could get 2 chances for a single quiz, and this could also help us to recapture the contents that we were not familiar enough too.",0,fa20
I wish the assignments were released earlier so that I could better allocate my time,0,fa20
I think the grading is a bit too harsh.,0,fa20
The A# have been rather tedious so far,0,fa20
The assignments are a bit long.,0,fa20
"I dislike the style of the lecture quizzes, mainly how there's only one attempt. It's adding additional stress to the course that I don't think is necessary, because it would be nice to be able to watch the videos without having to worry so much about performing well on the quizzes. ",0,fa20
nothing really to hate,0,fa20
"Pressure on the quizzes; sometimes the time limit feels too short, especially for questions such as the ones asking what graph would be the best choice for a given situation",0,fa20
"The quizzes are a (very) tiny bit anxiety inducing. Although I put my focus on the videos, the quizzes make me question myself quite a bit, especially when there are select all questions where some answers cause me confusion. ",0,fa20
"More coding tutoring (supplemental materials) is needed because I don't have a strong background in python, so it took a longer time for me to try out and process things. ",0,fa20
I guess the assignments since a lot of it we have to figure out on our own so a question can take a long while to solve. ,0,fa20
Nothing.,0,fa20
I like everything about this class,0,fa20
taking content quizes ,0,fa20
The week1 quizzes are tricky.,0,fa20
"The main project. I posed a question that I found interesting and did background research, but since turning it in, you have discussed predictive analysis and text analysis. I want to try these out in my project, but I don't know if I can change. I kinda wish there was a slack or piazza channel for the people doing the individual projects to discuss. ",0,fa20
The daily quizzes are probably what I like least about the class because some of the questions have been a bit ambiguous. ,0,fa20
Nothing worth noting,0,fa20
Answering quizes,0,fa20
I wish have more explain on the code part of the lecture.,0,fa20
Group Project work,0,fa20
"Don't have a lot practice, I think I will forget things fast.",0,fa20
"Some questions in quizzes are not so straightforward, and having only one attempt and limited time can be stressful.",0,fa20
Feeling unconfident in my final project group,0,fa20
Vague participation quiz questions,0,fa20
There is a lot of Python I need to learn.,0,fa20
"sometimes the videos each week take me a while because I like to take notes, and the quiz questions are sometimes unfair since there could be multiple answers.",0,fa20
The individual project proposal was challenging for me since I knew nothing about the data set so it might have been nice to know that my question was at least a little bit more on track,0,fa20
"The quizzes for each lecture. The quizzes are very difficult and I have lost a lot of points because of how specific they are. I think that if they are truly trying to gauge our understanding of the lecture we should have two or three attempts on each quiz. After submission we should be able to see which we got correct and which were wrong, not the correct answers. Then we should have the opportunity to retake it. I understand that we can miss points on the quizzes and still earn an A in the course but it should not be this difficult to earn these points if you just want to make sure we watch the lectures and understand the material.",0,fa20
"These EC surveys! This is the first one I've done, for some reason I didn't know about them until now. Prob missed a lot of free points!",0,fa20
Not much; Professor Ellis has been doing a great job so far. ,0,fa20
The final project because I dont know how it will turn out,0,fa20
"What I like least is probably the quizzes. I feel like there's a lot of quizzes, and while most of them are  not hard, there a few that I felt weren't really supposed to be taken right after watching the lecture but instead meant to be taken after I have had practice with the concept",0,fa20

more structure for the group project/more support from TA/IA's,0,fa20
"I guess I find the Jupyter notebook videos very dense and technical, but they're supposed to be that way and are helpful in completing assignments as a result. ",0,fa20
"The thing I like least about COGS 108 so far is that it stacks on top of my COGS 109 assignments and the only other coding-based class i've taken is COGS 18 so I can feel a bit overwhelmed with learning how to do things sometimes. But with the class itself, I actually enjoy it a lot!",0,fa20
"I feel like there is a slight disconnect from our final project and the class itself. I understand that we are learning the tools we need for our project in lecture, but I don't feel like we can immediately apply these specific learning points in such an open-ended project. Maybe it would be helpful to have weekly project goals connected to the weekly lecture content.",0,fa20
Lack of guidance in some of the homework where syntax is very specific,0,fa20
"My least favorite part of the course are the video quizzes only because we only have one attempt. I appreciate the fact that we get 10 free points toward the quizzes, but maybe with multiple attempts we could have a better chance at getting 100% on the quizzes and not need the 10 free points.",0,fa20
I enjoy this class,0,fa20
Probably the lecture quizzes just because I get thrown on every multiple-answer question and miss it.,0,fa20
"The quizzes. The quizzes stress me out since we have them every other day and there aren't many points to them, so if I missed one point, I basically failed the quiz. ",0,fa20
"The quizzes. I wish they weren't timed because I think I would do better on them given more time. While I am actively listening and taking notes over the videos, I do miss some details that are brought up in the quiz and I wish I had more time to go back and revisit that topic (especially if it is important enough to be covered on the quiz). ",0,fa20
"I don't really like how quizzes have to be done the day of by midnight, because sometimes i have a hectic day with other classes, work, and other things",0,fa20
It is ok. Thank you!,0,fa20
Very rare but sometimes I feel like the quiz questions were more vague or had multiple interpretations for certain ones ,0,fa20
"I wish for the quizzes we had an additional try or at least deadline extended to Saturday because every quiz (besides Friday) has a few days to be completed, so it would make sense for the Friday quiz to at least have one day of leniency.",0,fa20
the quizzes feel more of a requirement than an actual learning check ,0,fa20
I don't enjoy working on individual project so far because everything is virtual and it is harder for me to ask for help. It also seems very intimidating to finish up a Data science project on my own without much coding knowledge and without in person help. ,0,fa20
"Possibly because of the COVID-19 environment, but I do miss the feeling of being in a legitimate lecture environment and having synchronous lectures, as it gives me more of reason to actually attend lecture.",0,fa20
Quiz questions are too ambiguous,0,fa20
The PAs are a little bit challenging. I feel that lecture videos do not do a sufficient job in  preparing me for the PA,0,fa20
I wish there was a synchronous lecture at least once a week because it feels like I'm just self learning.,0,fa20
"I feel as though I'm not encouraged to take notes at all. I find it hard to take notes in coding classes, but even here still with more concepts, I find that I don't reach for my notebook often to write down important concepts. This could be a me problem, though, because the slides do have bullet points that outline the lesson and what you're going to say.",0,fa20
"I know professor give us easiest quzzies, but I feel that the time is too short.",0,fa20
some quiz questions can be tricky,0,fa20
There is not too much help regarding programming like CSE with the tutor labs.,0,fa20
I think that Python should be the only prerequisite for the course as opposed to Java. It would have been easier to start out with more comfortability in Python before starting the class.,0,fa20
None of I can think of so far.,0,fa20
Quizzes because a lot of the questions can be a bit confusing with the wording. ,0,fa20
I think some of the questions have been frustratingly ambiguous every once in a while. 95% of the time they are good representations of the content in the videos but every once in a while the answer is definitely not clear even if you watched the video.  ,0,fa20
Too easy. As a DSC major who has taken DSC10-80 much of the course is repeated material for me,0,fa20
The final project weights too much and becomes too decisive to our grades.,0,fa20
"The stress, since it is something that does not come easily to me, having to code is hard for me to understand sometimes, formatting specifically is what trips me up.",0,fa20
"I have least liked the pace of the class. For the first few weeks, everything seemed to be going off at a good pace, however, I feel now that we are moving a bit fast. ",0,fa20
"Working on the group project, it has been difficult logistically for us to work on the project",0,fa20
"There are too many quizzes, although manageable. Some questions in the first two weeks' quizzes are too detailed. ",0,fa20
Tricky canvas quiz questions,0,fa20
I miss raising my hand and asking questions in real time. ,0,fa20
The video quizzes being due the same day the video is released. It's been ok so far but the asynchronicity of my classes has made scheduling myself to do these quizzes sometimes difficult.,0,fa20
I like everything,0,fa20
A1,0,fa20
"I'm just mad I saved this class for last because it's the last class I need before graduating. Overall really great course, lectures are easy to follow, and assignments are fun.",0,fa20
"A few of the quizzes had questions that weren't related to the material discussed in the lecture (the data viz lectures, iirc)",0,fa20
I feel like I'm learning very slowly and I'm worried my level of coding is making it hard for me to contribute a lot for my group.,0,fa20
Doesn't feel like the hw and lectures are solidly connected,0,fa20
What I have like the least about COGS 108 has been having to write the project proposal. I disliked that because I feel like I didn't have enough knowledge of the tools I'm able to use for the project in order to form a plan on what topic I was choosing. ,0,fa20
Honestly. I wish that the reading quizzes had unlimited time. I don't see a reason to add such a short time period other than to make it more difficult. ,0,fa20
"I am struggling the most with the fact of how hard it can be to handle work for both the project, the lectures, the quizzes, and the assignments. The project takes many more hours than expected, and so far the only thing that keeps me going and makes me prioritize this class over others is my interest in the project. It could help a lot to have a bit more guidance on our projects, so that we can stay on track with time and find resources on time. ",0,fa20
"Nothing, I am really enjoying the class so far!",0,fa20
"Things in the assignments are not always explained in the lectures so I get confused as to how to do some things in the assignment, especially more complicated things.",0,fa20
"The sudden change in assignment due date frequency. I know that the schedule made it clear when assignments were due, but I was used to the two week gap between each assignment and now there is a one week gap.",0,fa20
"I find it generally quite hard to focus on the videos. Lastly, I think there is a lot of pressure to perform well on the quizzes and they often have questions that are a little tricky.",0,fa20
Project proposal instructions were ambiguous,0,fa20
Prof introduces little codes,0,fa20
the video quiz part. I think sometimes questions were very tricky and cannot represent the material we learn,0,fa20
I think the assignment has too low total score and it causes 1 point deduction on the total grade if we got 1 point deducted on one homework.,0,fa20
I think the assignment takes a very large part on total grade and have too low total points for each assignment. Therefore 1 point deducted on one assignment will cause one point deducted on the total average grade.,0,fa20
I like everything,0,fa20
I don't really like the weekly quizzes although I do understand that they are necessary.,0,fa20
"Learning git, github, and anaconda. Not especially a bad thing--it was just on the more difficult end for me",0,fa20
trying to actually find data sets for the project,0,fa20
"I dislike the ambiguity of some questions because it felt like some of the 'select all that apply' could have more or fewer answers depending on how the question was considered. However, I feel like last week's was definitely less ambiguous. ",0,fa20
Nothing that quickly comes to mind.,0,fa20
The online format could be better. More interaction with students is what I mean. It is hard to do it through canvas so not really a complaint but just my opinion.,0,fa20
"Not about COGS 108, but I probably should have waited a bit to refine my coding skills a bit more before I take this class.",0,fa20
The proposal took a long time to be returned. I want it to be returned soon so I can send out surveys which will take a long time,0,fa20
I can't think of anything that I do not like in the class.,0,fa20
"Maybe deadlines for things can be extended til saturday and not just friday. For this week, we have the daily quiz and the A3 due on the same night.",0,fa20
"I dislike how quizzes are graded. For most of my other classes with quizzes, they are graded for effort, which usually means if you scored a certain percentage of the quiz correctly (e.g. 75%) you get full points. Having a leeway of 10 points to cover for a missed week coupled on with points lost due to minor errors in quizzes can add up by the end of the quarter and make somewhat of an impact on the final grade.",0,fa20
I've disliked the project proposal because the topic was not very interesting to me.,0,fa20
"Learning how to use Git commands was definitely difficult despite carefully watching the lecture videos about that topic. The commands seem straightforward in lecture, but in practice doing a simple commit push was very ambiguous in practice since the UI is very complicated and everyones personal machines are different.

The guest lecture ,0,fa20
I wouldn't say I don't like it but I feel unprepared as of now for the group project.,0,fa20
Learning new tools.,0,fa20
"My least favorite part of the class might be working on the final project. It's definitely the hardest part of the class for me. I love working with my group, but the work expected from me each week has been slightly overwhelming. With it already being Week 5, I feel like we haven't made much progress, and I'm feeling a lot of pressure. In addition, the final project is so open-ended that it gives us more chances to make more mistakes in our project.",0,fa20
"The quizzes weigh heavy on me because I have used up the free 10 points already and usually, I miss on average 1-3 questions every week, so I am nervous that my grade will continue to drop. ",0,fa20
"The quizzes can sometimes have some vague questions, but overall I think the quality of the quizzes is fine and it is just a nitpick. ",0,fa20
the quiz should not set a deadline bc sometimes too busy to finish on time ,0,fa20
"The amount of work, pace of the course, and lack of connection between python notebook and lecture videos/notebooks.",0,fa20
Too many quizzes,0,fa20
Some hard concepts,0,fa20
"the quizzes sometimes have some tricky questions where I am overthinking and think it can be two option choices, and sometimes end up getting it wrong. Regardless, I like the material a lot! ",0,fa20

"There are way too many quizzes, it is hard to keep up.",0,fa20
I'd prefer mandatory quizzes to be optional or for extra credit.,0,fa20
"Some of the quiz question wordings can be a bit vague, but this is very rare. ",0,fa20
It's very easy to lose points. Especially for our final project. I'm confused about how it will be graded.,0,fa20
Nothing so far.,0,fa20
"i think this class is perfect. right speed, good lecture videos. One thing I miss is going to lecture in person but obviously that isnt possible right now.",0,fa20
My LEAST liked part of COGS 108 are the quizzes they are not always reflective of the material taught and ambiguous.,0,fa20
"One attempt per quiz, laptop has died in the middle of a quiz and by the time I was able to go back to the quiz it was a poor score. ",0,fa20
The syntax was went over fairly quickly and I am not sure I would have to remember the syntax. ,0,fa20
Sometimes the quiz answers are confusing and vague (people have mentioned it before on Piazza).,0,fa20
I think sometimes the quizzes are a bit too detailed. ,0,fa20

"Github, This is the first time I learn about Github. It sounds so sophisticated to me.",0,fa20
"The part that I liked least about COGS 108 is the process of finding a group for the final project, as it was difficult for me to find group members when people I asked did not seem to respond right away, while also forgetting to clear themselves from the teammate search once they had their group. I did not want to just ask too many different people and just work with whoever responds 1st in 1st come 1st serve type of manner since I felt I'd be disrespectful to those I bothered to ask, so I waited patiently to get responses from people I heard from 1st. Unfortunately, that costed me several days in the process of finding group members.",0,fa20
Group project. In progress but seems kind of difficult to me...,0,fa20
I don't really like the quizzes but I understand their importance to keep content in check. It is preferable to a midterm.,0,fa20
"Missing the quiz deadlines, which is mainly my fault. Also the project proposal guidelines were a bit vague ",0,fa20
"For the midterm questions, I didn't like that it was asking for terminology. I'm really bad at remembering terms because there's a lot of terms to sort through in my head so I don't know if it's the one the question is looking for. ",0,fa20

Missing tooo many points on those video quizzes :(,0,fa20
Taking quizzes for each lecture video,0,fa20
"Course content quizzes. I understand why they're a thing. It gets everyone in the class to watch the lecture videos. But I think the questions on there are way too niche. A lot of the questions don't focus on the general picture of the lectures or sometimes they ask ambiguous questions that may have multiple answers. For example, in one of our recent quizzes, we were asked two questions where we were given scenarios and had to pick the applicable confounding variable. Due to the fact that the question is more qualitative, it is bound to be ambiguous, but I'd be cool if it was a little more clear cut. But then again, it might just be me. ",0,fa20
"the quizzes are not my favorite. they are not that hard, but sometimes I make stupid mistakes, I hope there was more attempts for quizzes. ",0,fa20
"The quizzes. I feel like sometimes the quiz questions are a bit more advanced from lecture, which can be a good thing, but I don't know to expect it right after just watching the lecture.",0,fa20
The quiz is a little bit difficult than expected.,0,fa20
The lecture videos keep getting longer and longer and I don't have a large attention span anymore so I feel like I'm not getting a lot of information from them. I think it would be better to break them up into smaller videos of subtopics.,0,fa20
Nothing to complain about honestly,0,fa20
"I don't like the quizzes. They don't take me that long to complete the quizzes, however even though I take thorough notes, sometimes the questions are ambigious and are hard to answer, so I have missed a lot of points. ",0,fa20
My LEAST liked part of COGS 108 are the quizzes they are not always reflective of the material taught and ambiguous.,0,fa20
I think the project is a very daunting task made even more difficult with how groups are now separated. Being able to find a window within multiple student's schedule in the middle of this pandemic (and political chaos) is extremely difficult.,0,fa20
"The remote nature of the class, but there's nothing we can do about it :(",0,fa20
I was a bit unclear about the individual project proposal when it was initially assigned,0,fa20
"Group project; since this is anonymous, to be honest I wish I could have met and gotten to know my members beforehand rather than basically having to choose at random (based on piazza posts), especially since it counts for such a big part of my grade. It's a bit frustrating and kind of unfair imo. Either that or group projects shouldn't count for this much of the grade. It's hard to think these things through at the beginning of the quarter when deciding.  I also don't like that the class is remote; makes everything feel weird, including for group projects. idk

I accidentally submitted A1 late because I initially had a hard time keeping track of everything via canvass in my classes, so that was annoying, especially since I think I ended up getting everything correct. I don't think that's anyone's fault though, just a frustration on my end.

But otherwise I love the class content and class structure and think it's been very well designed. I wish Professor Ellis had more office hours throughout the week.",0,fa20
I have not really enjoyed having to take a quiz after every lecture video. I personally find having to take 7-10 quizzes a week slightly excessive but I do see the value in taking the quizzes. ,0,fa20
"final project, hard to decide what to do and how to begin",0,fa20
There is nothing in particular that I dislike about the class.,0,fa20
Some of the quiz questions are just a test on verbatim.,0,fa20
"The amount of emphasis on ""perfect memory"" for the quizzes. Human error combined with current circumstances kind of make it natural to get less than 95% of all points across all weeks. More ""free points"" or extra quiz questions(similar difficulty, or feedback related, for maybe a couple of points every week) would be helpful.",0,fa20

There are no live lectures,0,fa20

What I have liked the least about COGS 108 so far is the group project. Learning the material and completing the assignments on my own is already a lot of work. Having to worry about a different project where you have to depend on other people is too much given the world's current situation and my home environment.,0,fa20
I feel like I haven't had enough time to delve super deep into the topics because of my other classes : (,0,fa20

The pressure of the final project. I am having a hard time to be able to meet with my team and work on the project. I now sort of wish that I worked on the solo project that way I don't feel like I'm bringing my team down or vice versa.,0,fa20
honestly the final project. I don't really feel like there's a lot of instructor input so it is a little difficult to do a lot of outside work but hopefully that is just because we are just starting going through the datasets this week,0,fa20
